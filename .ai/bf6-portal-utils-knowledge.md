## Module: benchmarker

The `Benchmarker` namespace provides tiny, focused helpers for **measuring how long pure JavaScript work takes to run** inside Battlefield Portal’s QuickJS runtime. It lets you answer questions like “How many times can I safely run this loop in 10ms?” or “Roughly how expensive is this function per call?” without having to wire up your own timing loops.

**Important:** The module is designed for **local benchmarking and experimentation**, not for production in-game code paths. You should use it in isolated test mods, in small debug harnesses, or during development when tuning algorithms—then bake the insights into your final design.

Because timing inside a live server can be noisy (tick scheduling, other scripts, engine load), treat these tools as **directional**: use them to compare alternatives and to find safe budgets, not to guarantee exact numbers.

### Example: Comparing Two Implementations

```ts
import { Benchmarker } from 'bf6-portal-utils/benchmarker';

function implementationA(): void {
    // Some pure-JS logic
}

function implementationB(): void {
    // Alternative pure-JS logic
}

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    const iterations = 10_000;

    const totalMsA = Benchmarker.run(implementationA, iterations);
    const totalMsB = Benchmarker.run(implementationB, iterations);

    const perOpA = totalMsA / iterations;
    const perOpB = totalMsB / iterations;

    mod.Trace(`A: ${perOpA.toFixed(4)} ms/op, B: ${perOpB.toFixed(4)} ms/op`);
}
```

### Example: Finding a Safe Per-Tick Budget

```ts
import { Benchmarker } from 'bf6-portal-utils/benchmarker';

function expensiveWork(): void {
    // Pure-JS work you might want to do per player, per tick
}

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Roughly, how many times can we run this in ~5ms?
    const safeIterations = Benchmarker.findMaxIterations(expensiveWork, 5, 100);

    mod.Trace(`Safe iterations in 5ms window: ${safeIterations}`);
}
```

### Example: Async Benchmarking (Pure Promises Only)

```ts
import { Benchmarker } from 'bf6-portal-utils/benchmarker';

async function purePromiseWork(): Promise<void> {
    // NOTE: This must NOT call `mod.Wait()` or `Timers.setTimeout()`
    await Promise.resolve();
}

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    const iterations = 1_000;
    const totalMs = await Benchmarker.runAsync(purePromiseWork, iterations);
    const perOp = totalMs / iterations;

    mod.Trace(`Async work: ${perOp.toFixed(4)} ms/op (pure Promise version)`);
}
```

---

## Module: callback-handler

The `CallbackHandler` namespace provides a small utility for safely invoking user callbacks (sync or async). It catches synchronous throws and asynchronous promise rejections, logs them via a passed-in `Logging` instance, and does not rethrow—so a failing callback cannot kill the execution of the calling logic. Other modules in this repo (e.g. Timers, Events, UI, Raycast, Clocks) use it internally; you can use it in your own modules when invoking optional or user-provided callbacks.

### Example

```ts
import { CallbackHandler } from 'bf6-portal-utils/callback-handler';
import { Logging } from 'bf6-portal-utils/logging';

const logging = new Logging('MyModule');

// Optional callback with arguments
function notifyPlayer(player: mod.Player, message: string): void {
    CallbackHandler.invoke(this._onMessage, [player, message], 'onMessage', logging, Logging.LogLevel.Error);
}

// Optional no-args callback (e.g. timer tick, event fired)
function tick(): void {
    CallbackHandler.invokeNoArgs(this._onTick, 'onTick', logging, Logging.LogLevel.Error);
}
```

---

## Module: clocks

The `Clocks` namespace provides **CountUpClock** (stopwatch) and **CountDownClock** (timer) classes for Battlefield Portal experiences. Both are efficient, drift-resistant, and well-suited to UIs that need to update every second, every minute, or when the clock completes—e.g. match timers, round timers, or bomb fuse countdowns. Time is tracked internally as accumulated milliseconds while the clock is running; the next tick is scheduled to align with whole-second boundaries, minimizing drift. Callbacks (`onSecond`, `onMinute`, `onComplete`) are invoked only when the corresponding integer value changes, and errors in callbacks are caught and logged so they cannot break the clock.

### Example

```ts
import { Clocks } from 'bf6-portal-utils/clocks';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

Clocks.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Clocks.LogLevel.Info);

let roundClock: Clocks.CountDownClock;

Events.OnGameModeStarted.subscribe(() => {
    // 5-minute round timer; update UI every second, voice over every minute, and end round when time runs out
    roundClock = new Clocks.CountDownClock(5 * 60, {
        onSecond: (seconds) => updateTimerDisplay(seconds),
        onMinute: (minutes) => announceMinute(minutes),
        onComplete: () => endRound(),
    });
    roundClock.start();
});

Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe((player: mod.Player) => {
    // Stopwatch for a single player (e.g. lap time), with 1-hour limit
    const stopwatch = new Clocks.CountUpClock({
        timeLimitSeconds: 3600,
        onSecond: (seconds) => setHudSeconds(seconds),
        onComplete: () => showTimeLimitReached(),
    });
    stopwatch.start();
});

Events.OnPlayerDied.subscribe(
    (victim: mod.Player, killer: mod.Player, deathType: mod.DeathType, weapon: mod.WeaponUnlock) => {
        stopwatch.stop();
    }
);
```

## When Callbacks Fire (Lifecycle)

Callbacks are driven by an internal **tick** that runs when the clock starts or resumes, once after `stop()` or `pause()` (to commit elapsed time), on a timer at whole-second boundaries while running, and when `addSeconds()` or `subtractSeconds()` is called. Each tick checks whether an integer second or minute boundary has been reached or crossed since the last reported value, and whether the clock has reached its completion condition.

### `onSecond(currentSeconds: number)`

Fires every time the clock reaches or crosses an integer second boundary (see [Rounding](#rounding-count-up-vs-count-down)) for which it has not yet invoked `onSecond`. That can happen when:

- Time elapses normally while the clock is running (one firing per whole second).
- `start()` or `resume()` runs on a fresh or reset clock (first tick reports the current integer second).
- `stop()` or `pause()` commits elapsed time and the resulting value crosses a second boundary not yet reported.
- `addSeconds()` or `subtractSeconds()` adjusts time so that the integer second changes.

`reset()` does not run a tick and does not fire callbacks; the next `start()` will run a tick and report the new initial value.

### `onMinute(currentMinutes: number)`

Follows the same rules as `onSecond`, but for integer **minute** boundaries (derived from the rounded second value: `floor(seconds/60)` for count-up, `ceil(seconds/60)` for count-down).

### `onComplete()`

Fires at most once per clock when the completion condition is met during a tick:

- **CountDownClock:** when remaining time reaches 0.
- **CountUpClock:** when elapsed time reaches the optional `timeLimitSeconds` (default 86400 if not set).

That can happen when time elapses normally while running, or when `stop()` or `pause()` commits elapsed time and the clock is then in a completed state. `reset()` never fires `onComplete` as the clocks internal state is immediately reset before a tick can run to check for completion. In the tick where a CountDownClock reaches 0, `onComplete()` is invoked first, then `onSecond(0)` (and possibly `onMinute(0)`) in the same tick.

### Synchronous vs asynchronous callbacks

Synchronous callbacks run inside the tick and **block** the clock logic: the next tick is only scheduled via `setTimeout` after `onComplete`, `onSecond`, and `onMinute` have been invoked. The time until the next whole-second boundary is computed at that moment (when `setTimeout` is called), so the delay is based on the current time after your callbacks return. As a result, short synchronous callbacks should not cause drift—as long as they are not long-running (i.e. no longer than a second in total per tick). Asynchronous callbacks are preferred when you need to do more work, but short synchronous callbacks (e.g. updating a simple UI or game value, or playing a voice over) are safe.

## Module: events

This TypeScript `Events` namespace provides a centralized event subscription system for Battlefield Portal experience developers. In Battlefield Portal, each event handler function (like `OnPlayerDeployed`, `OngoingPlayer`, etc.) can only be implemented and exported once per entire project. This module implements all event handlers once, automatically hooking into every Battlefield Portal event, and exposes an API that allows you to subscribe to and unsubscribe from any event from multiple places in your codebase. This keeps your code clean, modular, and maintainable.

> **Note** Do not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions in your codebase. This module handles all event hooking automatically and it owns all those hooks.

### Example

```ts
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Optional: Configure error logging for handler failures
Events.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Events.LogLevel.Warning, true);

// Subscribe to player deployment events
function handlePlayerDeployed(player: mod.Player): void {
    console.log(`Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} deployed`);
}

// Subscribe to player death events with async handler
async function handlePlayerDied(
    player: mod.Player,
    otherPlayer: mod.Player,
    deathType: mod.DeathType,
    weaponUnlock: mod.WeaponUnlock
): Promise<void> {
    // Async operations are fully supported
    await mod.Wait(0.1);
    console.log(`Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} died`);
}

// Subscribe to ongoing player events
function handleOngoingPlayer(player: mod.Player): void {
    // This will be called every tick for every player
    const health = mod.GetSoldierState(player, mod.SoldierStateNumber.Health);

    if (health < 10) {
        // Low health logic
    }
}

// Set up subscriptions at module load time (top-level code)
const unsubscribeDeployed = Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe(handlePlayerDeployed);
const unsubscribeDied = Events.OnPlayerDied.subscribe(handlePlayerDied);
const unsubscribeOngoing = Events.OngoingPlayer.subscribe(handleOngoingPlayer);

// Optional: Clean up subscriptions when the game mode ends
Events.OnGameModeEnding.subscribe(() => {
    unsubscribeDeployed();
    unsubscribeDied();
    unsubscribeOngoing();
});
```

```ts
// Channel style (preferred)
const joinGameUnsubscribe = Events.OnPlayerJoinGame.subscribe((player: mod.Player) => {
    console.log(`Player joined game: ${mod.GetObjId(player)}`);
});
// Later, unsubscribe
joinGameUnsubscribe();

// Object style
const playerDeployedUnsubscribe = Events.subscribe(Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed, (player: mod.Player) => {
    console.log(`Player deployed: ${mod.GetObjId(player)}`);
});
// Later, unsubscribe
playerDeployedUnsubscribe();
```

```ts
const handler = (player: mod.Player) => console.log(`Player deployed: ${mod.GetObjId(player)}`);

// Channel style (preferred)
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe(handler);
// Later...
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.unsubscribe(handler);

// Object style
Events.subscribe(Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed, handler);
// Later...
Events.unsubscribe(Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed, handler);
```

#### Trigger

Manually triggers an event with the given parameters. Primarily useful for debugging or testing. In normal operation, events are automatically triggered by the Battlefield Portal runtime when the corresponding game events occur.

**Channel style:**

- **Signature:** `Events.<EventName>.trigger(...args): void`
- **Parameters:** `...args` – The parameters matching this event's signature (e.g. for `OnPlayerDeployed`: `player`).

**Enum style:**

- **Signature:** `Events.trigger<T extends Type>(type: T, ...args: EventParameters<T>): void`
- **Parameters:** `type` – The event type from `Events.Type` (trigger function for that event); `...args` – The parameters matching the event type's signature.

**Examples:**

```ts
const testPlayer = mod.ValueInArray(mod.AllPlayers(), 0) as mod.Player;

// Channel style (preferred)
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.trigger(testPlayer);

// Object style
Events.trigger(Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed, testPlayer);
```

```ts
// Channel style (preferred)
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe(someHandler);
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.handlerCount(); // 1

// Object style
Events.subscribe(Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed, someOtherHandler);
Events.handlerCount(Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed); // 2
```

#### `Events.Type`

An object mapping each event name to its trigger function (e.g. `Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed`). Use these values with the object-style API: `Events.subscribe(type, handler)`, `Events.unsubscribe(type, handler)`, `Events.trigger(type, ...args)`, and `Events.handlerCount(type)`. You can also use it for typed references to event payloads (e.g. `Parameters<typeof Events.Type.OnPlayerDied>`) or to call a trigger by name (e.g. `Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed(somePlayer)`).

**Example (typed payload / dynamic dispatch):**

```ts
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Typed payload for OnPlayerDied
type OnPlayerDiedPayload = Parameters<typeof Events.Type.OnPlayerDied>;
// [player: mod.Player, otherPlayer: mod.Player, deathType: mod.DeathType, weaponUnlock: mod.WeaponUnlock]

// Call a trigger by name (mostly for debugging or testing).
Events.Type.OnPlayerDeployed(somePlayer);
```

Available event types include:

- `OngoingGlobal`, `OngoingAreaTrigger`, `OngoingCapturePoint`, `OngoingEmplacementSpawner`, `OngoingHQ`, `OngoingInteractPoint`, `OngoingLootSpawner`, `OngoingMCOM`, `OngoingPlayer`, `OngoingRingOfFire`, `OngoingSector`, `OngoingSpawner`, `OngoingSpawnPoint`, `OngoingTeam`, `OngoingVehicle`, `OngoingVehicleSpawner`, `OngoingWaypointPath`, `OngoingWorldIcon`
- `OnAIMoveToFailed`, `OnAIMoveToRunning`, `OnAIMoveToSucceeded`
- `OnAIParachuteRunning`, `OnAIParachuteSucceeded`
- `OnAIWaypointIdleFailed`, `OnAIWaypointIdleRunning`, `OnAIWaypointIdleSucceeded`
- `OnCapturePointCaptured`, `OnCapturePointCapturing`, `OnCapturePointLost`
- `OnGameModeEnding`, `OnGameModeStarted`
- `OnPlayerJoinGame`, `OnPlayerLeaveGame`
- `OnPlayerDeployed`, `OnPlayerUndeploy`
- `OnMandown`, `OnRevived`, `OnPlayerDamaged`, `OnPlayerDied`, `OnPlayerEarnedKill`, `OnPlayerEarnedKillAssist`, `OnPlayerInteract`, `OnPlayerSwitchTeam`, `OnPlayerUIButtonEvent`
- `OnPlayerEnterAreaTrigger`, `OnPlayerExitAreaTrigger`
- `OnPlayerEnterCapturePoint`, `OnPlayerExitCapturePoint`
- `OnPlayerEnterVehicle`, `OnPlayerExitVehicle`
- `OnPlayerEnterVehicleSeat`, `OnPlayerExitVehicleSeat`
- `OnPlayerEnterVL7Cloud`, `OnPlayerExitVL7Cloud`
- `OnPortalGadgetAimStart`, `OnPortalGadgetAimStop`, `OnPortalGadgetFireStart`, `OnPortalGadgetFireStop`, `OnPortalGadgetLaserToggle`
- `OnMCOMArmed`, `OnMCOMDefused`, `OnMCOMDestroyed`
- `OnRayCastHit`, `OnRayCastMissed`
- `OnRingOfFireZoneSizeChange`
- `OnSpawnerSpawned`
- `OnTimeLimitReached`
- `OnVehicleDestroyed`, `OnVehicleSpawned`

```ts
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Configure logging with console.log, minimum level of Warning, and include error details
Events.setLogging(
    (text) => console.log(text),
    Events.LogLevel.Warning,
    true // includeError
);

// If a handler throws an error, it will be logged automatically
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe((player: mod.Player) => {
    // If this throws, it will be logged as: <Events> Error in handler handleDeployment: [error details]
    throw new Error('Something went wrong');
});
```

## Usage Patterns

- **Modular Event Handling** – Split your event handling logic across multiple files or modules. Each module can subscribe to the events it needs without conflicts.

- **Conditional Subscriptions** – Subscribe and unsubscribe handlers dynamically based on game state. For example, only subscribe to vehicle events when vehicles are enabled.

- **Multiple Handlers per Event** – Subscribe multiple handlers to the same event to handle different concerns separately (e.g., one handler for logging, another for game logic, another for UI updates).

- **Async Operations** – Use async handlers for operations that require waiting, such as delayed actions or sequential operations.

- **Error Handling** – Since errors in handlers are isolated, you can add try-catch blocks within individual handlers for fine-grained error handling without affecting other subscriptions.

### Advanced Example

This example demonstrates how multiple modules across different files can subscribe to the same events independently, highlighting the key benefit of the Events system. Each module handles its own concerns without conflicts.

**File: `src/stats/player-stats.ts`**

```ts
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Player statistics tracking module
class PlayerStats {
    private kills = new Map<number, number>();
    private deaths = new Map<number, number>();

    private unsubscribeFunctions: (() => void)[] = [];

    public constructor() {
        // Subscribe to player events for stats tracking
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.push(Events.OnPlayerEarnedKill.subscribe(this.handleKill.bind(this)));
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.push(Events.OnPlayerDied.subscribe(this.handleDeath.bind(this)));
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.push(Events.OnPlayerLeaveGame.subscribe(this.handleLeave.bind(this)));
    }

    private handleKill(
        player: mod.Player,
        otherPlayer: mod.Player,
        deathType: mod.DeathType,
        weaponUnlock: mod.WeaponUnlock
    ): void {
        const playerId = mod.GetObjId(player);
        this.kills.set(playerId, (this.kills.get(playerId) || 0) + 1);
    }

    private handleDeath(
        player: mod.Player,
        otherPlayer: mod.Player,
        deathType: mod.DeathType,
        weaponUnlock: mod.WeaponUnlock
    ): void {
        const playerId = mod.GetObjId(player);
        this.deaths.set(playerId, (this.deaths.get(playerId) || 0) + 1);
    }

    private handleLeave(playerId: number): void {
        this.kills.delete(playerId);
        this.deaths.delete(playerId);
    }

    public getKills(player: mod.Player): number {
        return this.kills.get(mod.GetObjId(player)) || 0;
    }

    public getDeaths(player: mod.Player): number {
        return this.deaths.get(mod.GetObjId(player)) || 0;
    }

    public cleanup(): void {
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.forEach((unsub) => unsub());
    }
}

let stats: PlayerStats;

Events.OnGameModeStarted.subscribe(() => {
    stats = new PlayerStats();
});

Events.OnGameModeEnding.subscribe(() => {
    stats?.cleanup();
});
```

**File: `src/logging/game-logger.ts`**

```ts
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Game event logging module - subscribes to the SAME events as PlayerStats
class GameLogger {
    private unsubscribeFunctions: (() => void)[] = [];

    public constructor() {
        // Multiple modules can subscribe to the same events!
        // This logger also listens to OnPlayerEarnedKill and OnPlayerDied
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.push(Events.OnPlayerEarnedKill.subscribe(this.logKill.bind(this)));
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.push(Events.OnPlayerDied.subscribe(this.logDeath.bind(this)));
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.push(Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe(this.logDeployment.bind(this)));
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.push(Events.OnVehicleSpawned.subscribe(this.logVehicleSpawn.bind(this)));
    }

    private logKill(
        player: mod.Player,
        otherPlayer: mod.Player,
        deathType: mod.DeathType,
        weaponUnlock: mod.WeaponUnlock
    ): void {
        console.log(
            `[KILL] Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} killed Player ${mod.GetObjId(otherPlayer)} with ${weaponUnlock}`
        );
    }

    private logDeath(
        player: mod.Player,
        otherPlayer: mod.Player,
        deathType: mod.DeathType,
        weaponUnlock: mod.WeaponUnlock
    ): void {
        console.log(`[DEATH] Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} died`);
    }

    private logDeployment(player: mod.Player): void {
        console.log(`[DEPLOY] Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} deployed`);
    }

    private logVehicleSpawn(vehicle: mod.Vehicle): void {
        console.log(`[VEHICLE] Vehicle ${mod.GetObjId(vehicle)} spawned`);
    }

    public cleanup(): void {
        this.unsubscribeFunctions.forEach((unsub) => unsub());
    }
}

let logger: GameLogger;

Events.OnGameModeStarted.subscribe(() => {
    logger = new GameLogger();
});

Events.OnGameModeEnding.subscribe(() => {
    logger?.cleanup();
});
```

**File: `src/index.ts`**

```ts
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Main entry point - just import the modules, they handle their own subscriptions
import './stats/player-stats';
import './logging/game-logger';

// You can also subscribe to events directly in the main file
Events.OnGameModeStarted.subscribe(() => {
    console.log('Game mode started - all modules initialized');
});

// Multiple handlers for the same event work perfectly!
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe((player: mod.Player) => {
    // This handler runs alongside the HUD's handler
    console.log(`Main: Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} deployed`);
});
```

This example demonstrates:

- **Multiple subscriptions to the same event** – `OnPlayerEarnedKill` is subscribed to by `PlayerStats` and `GameLogger`, and all handlers execute independently.

- **Modular code organization** – Each module manages its own subscriptions without knowing about other modules.

- **No conflicts** – All modules can subscribe to any event without interfering with each other.

- **Clean separation of concerns** – Stats tracking, logging, and UI updates are handled in separate files but all respond to the same game events.

## Known Limitations & Caveats

- **Tick Budget (~50ms)** – The server may abort the JavaScript process for a game tick if total work exceeds its per-tick cap, leading to incomplete event executions. The module logs how many triggers did not complete per event type over a rolling window; see [Tick Budget and Incomplete Triggers](#tick-budget-and-incomplete-triggers) for details and mitigation.

- **Single Event Hook Requirement** – You must not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions in your own code. If you do, they will conflict with this module's implementations and cause undefined behavior.

- **Handler Reference Equality** – When unsubscribing, you must pass the exact same function reference that was used in `subscribe()`. Anonymous functions cannot be unsubscribed unless you store the reference. **Recommended:** Use the unsubscribe function returned by `subscribe()` instead of storing handler references.

- **Execution Order** – Handler execution order is not guaranteed. If you need handlers to execute in a specific order, chain them manually or use a single handler that calls other functions in order.

- **No Return Values** – Event handlers cannot return values to the caller. All handlers return `void` or `Promise<void>`. If you need to collect results, use shared state or callbacks.

- **Completion and Ordering** – Synchronous handlers complete before the trigger returns; asynchronous handlers are not awaited, so you cannot rely on async handlers finishing before other code runs. Long-running synchronous handlers block other handlers and the caller—prefer async handlers for non-trivial work. Use promises or callbacks if you need to wait for handler completion.

## Module: ffa-drop-ins

This TypeScript `FFADropIns` namespace enables Free For All (FFA) spawning for custom Battlefield Portal experiences by short-circuiting the normal deploy process in favor of a custom UI prompt with developer-curated drop-in spawn points. The system asks players if they would like to spawn now or be asked again after a delay, allowing players to adjust their loadout and settings at the deploy screen without being locked out.

The spawning system accepts an arbitrary region of individual rectangles and an altitude. You call `FFADropIns.initialize()` to set up spawn points, `FFADropIns.enableSpawnQueueProcessing()` / `disableSpawnQueueProcessing()` to control queue processing, and create `FFADropIns.Soldier` instances per player.

> **Note** The `FFADropIns` namespace depends on the `UI` and `Events` namespaces (both in this repository) and the `mod` namespace (available in the `bf6-portal-mod-types` package). Internally it uses `Timers`, `Clocks`, and `Vectors` from this repository. **You must use the `Events` module as your only mechanism to subscribe to game events**—do not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions in your own code. `FFADropIns` subscribes to `Events.OnPlayerLeaveGame` to clear per-player state and avoid resource leaks when a player leaves; the `UI` module uses `Events` to register the button handler. Because only one implementation of each Portal event can exist per project (the `Events` module owns those hooks), your mod must subscribe via `Events` only. See the [Events module — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).

### Example

```ts
import { FFADropIns } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ffa-drop-ins';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Define your drop-in region: rectangles (minX, minZ, maxX, maxZ) and altitude (y)
const DROP_IN_REGION: FFADropIns.SpawnData = {
    spawnRectangles: [
        { minX: -200, minZ: -200, maxX: 200, maxZ: 200 }, // First area
        { minX: 300, minZ: 100, maxX: 500, maxZ: 300 }, // Second area
    ],
    y: 300, // Altitude for drop-in (players spawn in the air and skydive until they open their parachute)
};

Events.OnGameModeStarted.subscribe(() => {
    FFADropIns.initialize(DROP_IN_REGION, {
        dropInPoints: 64, // Optional (default 64) – number of spawn points to pre-create
        initialPromptDelay: 10, // Optional (default 10 seconds)
        promptDelay: 10, // Optional (default 10 seconds)
        queueProcessingDelay: 2, // Optional (default 2 seconds)
    });

    FFADropIns.enableSpawnQueueProcessing();

    FFADropIns.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), FFADropIns.LogLevel.Info);
});

Events.OnPlayerJoinGame.subscribe((eventPlayer: mod.Player) => {
    const soldier = new FFADropIns.Soldier(eventPlayer, false);
    soldier.startDelayForPrompt();
});

Events.OnPlayerUndeploy.subscribe((eventPlayer: mod.Player) => {
    FFADropIns.Soldier.startDelayForPrompt(eventPlayer);
});
```

## Debugging & Development Tools

### Debug Position Display

The `Soldier` constructor accepts an optional `showDebugPosition` parameter (default: `false`) that enables a real-time position display for developers. When enabled, the player's X, Y, and Z coordinates are displayed at the bottom center of the screen, updating every second.

**Use Case**: Useful for finding and documenting drop-in regions and altitude (e.g. flying around to set rectangle bounds and `y`).

**Coordinate Format**: Coordinates are scaled by 100 and truncated (using integer truncation) to avoid Portal's decimal display issues. Divide the displayed value by 100 to get actual world coordinates.

**Example Usage**:

```ts
Events.OnPlayerJoinGame.subscribe((eventPlayer: mod.Player) => {
    const soldier = new FFADropIns.Soldier(eventPlayer, mod.GetObjId(eventPlayer) === 0);
    soldier.startDelayForPrompt();
});
```

### Required event subscription (via Events only)

You must **not** implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions. Subscribe to game events only through the `Events` module:

1. **`Events.OnGameModeStarted`** – In your subscriber, call `FFADropIns.initialize()` with your spawn data (rectangles + altitude) and `FFADropIns.enableSpawnQueueProcessing()` to start the system.
2. **`Events.OnPlayerJoinGame`** – In your subscriber, create a new `FFADropIns.Soldier` instance for each player and call `soldier.startDelayForPrompt()` to begin the spawn flow.
3. **`Events.OnPlayerUndeploy`** – In your subscriber, call `FFADropIns.Soldier.startDelayForPrompt(player)` to restart the spawn flow when players die or undeploy.

## Known Limitations & Caveats

- **Events module required** – You **must** use the [Events module](../events/README.md) for all game event subscription and **must not** implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions in your code. `FFADropIns` subscribes to `Events.OnPlayerLeaveGame` internally to clear per-player state and avoid resource leaks when a player leaves; the `UI` module also uses `Events` to register the button handler. Only one implementation of each Portal event can exist per project, and the Events module owns those hooks. If you export your own `OnPlayerJoinGame`, `OnGameModeStarted`, etc., they will conflict and cause undefined behavior. See [Events — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).
- **Random spawn selection** – When spawning from the queue, the system picks uniformly at random from the pre-created drop-in points. Two players can land at or near the same spot. There is no safe-distance or player-proximity logic (unlike `FFASpawnPoints`). For more spread, increase `dropInPoints` or use multiple rectangles with larger total area.
- **UI Input Mode** – The system delegates automatic `mod.EnableUIInputMode()` management to the `UI` module. Be careful not to conflict with other UI systems that do not use the `UI` module that also control input mode.
- **HQ Disabling** – The system automatically disables both team HQs during initialization. If you need team-based spawning elsewhere, you'll need to re-enable HQs manually (but you really should not be mixing this with other systems unless you know what you are doing).
- **Spawn Point Cleanup** – Spawn points created during initialization are not automatically cleaned up. This is typically fine as they persist for the duration of the match.
- **AI parachute behavior** – AI tend to open their parachutes very early and then fall slowly, making them easy targets for attackers and likely affecting game balance. Be aware of this when mixing human and AI players in drop-in modes.
- **AI parachute timing and altitude** – No testing has been done to determine how much fall time (effective altitude) AI need to properly automatically open their parachutes. More work is needed to better control how and when AI open their chutes for balance and safety (e.g. minimum altitude, delay before open, or other tuning).

## Module: ffa-spawn-points

This TypeScript `FFASpawnPoints` namespace enables Free For All (FFA) spawning for custom Battlefield Portal experiences by short-circuiting the normal deploy process in favor of a custom UI prompt with developer-curated fixed spawn points. The system asks players if they would like to spawn now or be asked again after a delay, allowing players to adjust their loadout and settings at the deploy screen without being locked out.

The spawning system uses an intelligent algorithm to find safe spawn points that are appropriately distanced from other players, reducing the chance of spawning directly into combat while maintaining reasonable spawn times. You call `FFASpawnPoints.initialize()` to set up spawn points, `FFASpawnPoints.enableSpawnQueueProcessing()` / `disableSpawnQueueProcessing()` to control queue processing, and create `FFASpawnPoints.Soldier` instances per player.

> **Note** The `FFASpawnPoints` namespace depends on the `UI` and `Events` namespaces (both in this repository) and the `mod` namespace (available in the `bf6-portal-mod-types` package). Internally it uses `Timers`, `Clocks`, and `Vectors` from this repository. **You must use the `Events` module as your only mechanism to subscribe to game events**—do not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions in your own code. `FFASpawnPoints` subscribes to `Events.OnPlayerLeaveGame` to clear per-player state and avoid resource leaks when a player leaves; the `UI` module uses `Events` to register the button handler. Because only one implementation of each Portal event can exist per project (the `Events` module owns those hooks), your mod must subscribe via `Events` only. See the [Events module — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).

### Example

```ts
import { FFASpawnPoints } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ffa-spawn-points';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Define your spawn points
const SPAWN_POINTS: FFASpawnPoints.SpawnData[] = [
    [100, 0, 200, 0], // x = 100, y = 0, z = 200, orientation = 0 (North)
    [-100, 0, 200, 90], // x = -100, y = 0, z = 200, orientation = 90 (East)
    [0, 0, -200, 180], // x = 0, y = 0, z = -200, orientation = 180 (South)
    [-200, 100, 300, 270], // x = -200, y = 100, z = 300, orientation = 270 (West)
    // ... more spawn points
];

Events.OnGameModeStarted.subscribe(() => {
    // Initialize the spawning system
    FFASpawnPoints.initialize(SPAWN_POINTS, {
        minimumSafeDistance: 20, // Optional override (default 20)
        maximumInterestingDistance: 40, // Optional override (default 40)
        safeOverInterestingFallbackFactor: 1.5, // Optional override (default 1.5)
        maxSpawnCandidates: 12, // Optional override (default 12)
        initialPromptDelay: 10, // Optional override (default 10 seconds)
        promptDelay: 10, // Optional override (default 10 seconds)
        queueProcessingDelay: 1, // Optional override (default 1 second)
    });

    // Enable spawn queue processing
    FFASpawnPoints.enableSpawnQueueProcessing();

    // Optional: Configure logging for spawn system debugging
    FFASpawnPoints.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), FFASpawnPoints.LogLevel.Info);
});

Events.OnPlayerJoinGame.subscribe((eventPlayer: mod.Player) => {
    // Create a FFASpawnPoints.Soldier instance for each player
    // Pass `true` as the second parameter to enable debug position display (useful for finding spawn points).
    const soldier = new FFASpawnPoints.Soldier(eventPlayer, false);

    // Start the delay countdown for the player.
    soldier.startDelayForPrompt();
});

Events.OnPlayerUndeploy.subscribe((eventPlayer: mod.Player) => {
    // Start the delay countdown when a player undeploys (is ready to deploy again).
    FFASpawnPoints.Soldier.startDelayForPrompt(eventPlayer);
});
```

## Debugging & Development Tools

### Debug Position Display

The `Soldier` constructor accepts an optional `showDebugPosition` parameter (default: `false`) that enables a real-time position display for developers. When enabled, the player's X, Y, and Z coordinates are displayed at the bottom center of the screen, updating every second.

**Use Case**: This feature is intended for developers who want to move around maps to find and document spawn positions, as Battlefield Portal does not provide a built-in way to display coordinates in-game.

**Coordinate Format**: Coordinates are scaled by 100 and truncated (using integer truncation) to avoid Portal's decimal display issues. For example:

- A position of `-100.24` will be displayed as `-10024`
- A position of `50.67` will be displayed as `5067`

To convert back to the actual world coordinates, divide the displayed value by 100.

**Example Usage**:

```ts
export async function OnPlayerJoinGame(eventPlayer: mod.Player): Promise<void> {
    // Enable debug position display for development/testing for the first joining player (usually the admin).
    const soldier = new FFASpawnPoints.Soldier(eventPlayer, mod.GetObjId(eventPlayer) === 0);

    soldier.startDelayForPrompt();
}
```

### Required event subscription (via Events only)

You must **not** implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions. Subscribe to game events only through the `Events` module:

1. **`Events.OnGameModeStarted`** – In your subscriber, call `FFASpawnPoints.initialize()` with your spawn points and `FFASpawnPoints.enableSpawnQueueProcessing()` to start the system.
2. **`Events.OnPlayerJoinGame`** – In your subscriber, create a new `FFASpawnPoints.Soldier` instance for each player and call `soldier.startDelayForPrompt()` to begin the spawn flow.
3. **`Events.OnPlayerUndeploy`** – In your subscriber, call `FFASpawnPoints.Soldier.startDelayForPrompt(player)` to restart the spawn flow when players die or undeploy.

## Known Limitations & Caveats

- **Events module required** – Since `FFASpawnPoints` relies on `Events` and `UI`, you **must** use the [Events module](../events/README.md) for all game event subscription and **must not** implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions in your code. If you export your own `OnPlayerJoinGame`, `OnGameModeStarted`, etc., they will conflict and cause undefined behavior. See [Events — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).
- **Rare Spawn Overlaps** – In rare cases, especially with many players and few spawn points, players may spawn on top of each other if no safe spawn point is found within `maxSpawnCandidates` iterations. Consider adjusting `maxSpawnCandidates` via the `FFASpawnPoints.initialize()` options or adding more spawn points to mitigate this.
- **UI Input Mode** – The system delegates automatic `mod.EnableUIInputMode()` management to the `UI` module. Be careful not to conflict with other UI systems that do not use the `UI` module that also control input mode.
- **HQ Disabling** – The system automatically disables both team HQs during initialization. If you need team-based spawning elsewhere, you'll need to re-enable HQs manually (but you really should not be mixing this with other systems unless you know what you are doing).
- **Spawn Point Cleanup** – Spawn points created during initialization are not automatically cleaned up. This is typically fine as they persist for the duration of the match.

## Module: logger

This TypeScript `Logger` class removes the biggest Battlefield Portal debugging pain point: until now you could only display strings that were pre-uploaded to the Experience website via a `strings.json` file, and displaying concatenated string with more than 3 parts was tricky, if not impossible. Further, `console.log` is only available for PC users, with a file written to their filesystem. By pairing a lightweight UI window with the `logger.strings.json` character map, this module lets you log any runtime text (errors, telemetry, formatted data, etc.) directly to the screen, even on console builds.

- **Dynamic mode** behaves like a scrolling console, always appending at the bottom and pushing older rows upward.
- **Static mode** lets you target a specific row index (e.g., keep player position on row 10 while other diagnostics fill lines 0‑9).

> **Note** Since the `Logger` namespace depends on the `UI` module, which depends on the `Events` module **you must use the `Events` module as your only mechanism to subscribe to game events**—do not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions in your own code. Because only one implementation of each Portal event can exist per project (the `Events` module owns those hooks), your mod must subscribe via `Events` only. See the [Events module — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).

## Usage Patterns

- **Static dashboards** – Pin persistent diagnostics (positions, squad metadata, timers) to precise rows.
- **Dynamic consoles** – Stream verbose traces (button clicks, state transitions, error stacks) without worrying about pre-provisioned strings.
- **Multiple Instances** – Keep both modes active: e.g., static logger on the left for gauges, dynamic logger on the right for realtime traces.
- **Performance considerations** – For long text messages or tall dynamic loggers, use `logAsync()` instead of `log()`. Long text can result in many 3-character Text UI Widgets, and in dynamic mode, moving all existing rows upward requires many UI operations. By using `logAsync()` without `await`, the logging operation becomes non-blocking by being sent to the microtask queue, preventing frame drops or execution delays.

### Example

```ts
import { Logger } from 'bf6-portal-utils/logger';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

let staticLogger: Logger | undefined;
let dynamicLogger: Logger | undefined;

export async function OnPlayerDeployed(eventPlayer: mod.Player): Promise<void> {
    if (!staticLogger) {
        staticLogger = new Logger(eventPlayer, {
            staticRows: true,
            visible: true,
            anchor: mod.UIAnchor.TopLeft,
            width: 600,
        });
        dynamicLogger = new Logger(eventPlayer, { staticRows: false, visible: true, anchor: mod.UIAnchor.TopRight });
    }

    // While logAsync is preferred, you can still use log() for short messages if order guarantees matter.
    dynamicLogger?.log(`Player: ${mod.GetObjId(player)}`);
    dynamicLogger?.log(`Team: ${mod.GetObjId(mod.GetTeam(player))}`);
    dynamicLogger?.log(`Hello @ world $${(12345.6789).toFixed(2)}!!`);

    // For long messages or performance-critical paths, always use logAsync (non-blocking).
    dynamicLogger?.logAsync(`Very long diagnostic message that will create many UI widgets...`);

    while (true) {
        const position = mod.GetSoldierState(player, mod.SoldierStateVector.GetPosition);

        const x = mod.XComponentOf(position).toFixed(2);
        const y = mod.YComponentOf(position).toFixed(2);
        const z = mod.ZComponentOf(position).toFixed(2);

        staticLogger?.log(`Position: <${x},${y},${z}>`, 13);

        await mod.Wait(0.5);

        if (!mod.GetSoldierState(player, mod.SoldierStateBool.IsReloading)) continue;
    }
}
```

## Module: logging

This TypeScript `Logging` class provides a fail-safe logging abstraction for Battlefield Portal experience developers. It abstracts away the logic to log text and errors to an arbitrary logging method in a fail-safe way, with configurable log level filtering. The class can be used directly within a BF6 Portal experience or can be used within other modules to provide consistent, safe logging functionality.

Key features include fail-safe error handling that prevents logging failures from crashing your mod, configurable log level filtering to control verbosity, optional error message inclusion, support for both synchronous and asynchronous logger functions, and automatic error-to-string conversion that safely handles any error type.

### Example: Direct Usage in Portal Experience

```ts
import { Logging } from 'bf6-portal-utils/logging';

const logging = new Logging('MyMod');

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Set up logging with console.log, minimum log level of Warning, and include errors
    logging.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Logging.LogLevel.Warning, true);

    // Log an info message
    logging.log('Game mode started', Logging.LogLevel.Info); // Won't be logged

    if (!someCheck()) {
        // Log an warning message
        logging.log('Some check failed', Logging.LogLevel.Warning);
    }

    // Log an error with an error object
    try {
        someRiskyOperation();
    } catch (error) {
        logging.log('Failed to perform operation', Logging.LogLevel.Error, error);
    }

    // Debug messages won't be logged if log level is Warning or higher
    logging.log('Debug information', Logging.LogLevel.Debug); // Won't be logged
}
```

### Example: Usage Within a Module

```ts
import { Logging } from '../logging/index.ts';

export namespace MyModule {
    const logging = new Logging('MyModule');

    /**
     * Re-export LogLevel enum for convenience for controlling logging verbosity.
     */
    export const LogLevel = Logging.LogLevel;

    /**
     * Attaches a logger and defines a minimum log level and whether to include the runtime error in the log.
     * @param log - The logger function to use. Pass undefined to disable logging.
     * @param logLevel - The minimum log level to use.
     * @param includeError - Whether to include the runtime error in the log.
     */
    export function setLogging(
        log?: (text: string) => Promise<void> | void,
        logLevel?: Logging.LogLevel,
        includeError?: boolean
    ): void {
        logging.setLogging(log, logLevel, includeError);
    }

    export function doSomething(): void {
        // Use the logging internally
        logging.log('Doing something', Logging.LogLevel.Info);
    }
}

// Usage in experience:
// MyModule.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), MyModule.LogLevel.Info);
```

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Logging

```ts
import { Logging } from 'bf6-portal-utils/logging';

const logging = new Logging('MyMod');

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Set up logging
    logging.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Logging.LogLevel.Info);

    // Log messages at different levels
    logging.log('Debug message', Logging.LogLevel.Debug); // Won't be logged (below Info)
    logging.log('Info message', Logging.LogLevel.Info); // Will be logged
    logging.log('Warning message', Logging.LogLevel.Warning); // Will be logged
    logging.log('Error message', Logging.LogLevel.Error); // Will be logged
}
```

### Error Logging

```ts
import { Logging } from 'bf6-portal-utils/logging';

const logging = new Logging('MyMod');

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Enable error inclusion
    logging.setLogging(
        (text) => console.log(text),
        Logging.LogLevel.Warning,
        true // includeError = true
    );

    try {
        riskyOperation();
    } catch (error) {
        // Error will be appended to the log message
        logging.log('Operation failed', Logging.LogLevel.Error, error);
        // Output: <MyMod> Operation failed - Error: [error message]
    }
}
```

### Conditional Logging with `willLog()`

```ts
import { Logging } from 'bf6-portal-utils/logging';

const logging = new Logging('MyMod');

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    logging.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Logging.LogLevel.Warning);

    // Avoid expensive string building if logging won't occur
    if (logging.willLog(Logging.LogLevel.Debug)) {
        const expensiveData = buildExpensiveDebugString();
        logging.log(expensiveData, Logging.LogLevel.Debug);
    }
}
```

### Async Logger Functions

```ts
import { Logging } from 'bf6-portal-utils/logging';

const logging = new Logging('MyMod');

async function asyncLogger(text: string): Promise<void> {
    // Simulate async logging (e.g., sending to external service)
    await someAsyncLoggingService.log(text);
}

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Async loggers are fully supported
    logging.setLogging(asyncLogger, Logging.LogLevel.Info);

    // If the async logger rejects, it's caught and logged to console
    logging.log('This will be sent async', Logging.LogLevel.Info);
}
```

### Disabling Logging

```ts
import { Logging } from 'bf6-portal-utils/logging';

const logging = new Logging('MyMod');

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Initially enable logging
    logging.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Logging.LogLevel.Info);

    logging.log('This will be logged', Logging.LogLevel.Info);

    // Disable logging by passing undefined
    logging.setLogging(undefined);

    logging.log('This will not be logged', Logging.LogLevel.Info);
}
```

## Known Limitations & Caveats

- **Error String Conversion Limitations** – While the class safely converts errors to strings, complex error objects may lose information in the conversion process. Only the error message (for `Error` instances) or the result of `String()` conversion is preserved. Also, while a logger like `console.log` can easily accept complex and log error objects or strings, other UI loggers (like the `Logger` module) may not, so consider `includeError = false` unless necessary.

- **Async Logger Timing** – If a logger function returns a `Promise`, the `log()` method does not await it. The promise is handled in a fire-and-forget manner to prevent blocking. This means you cannot rely on the log operation completing before your code continues.

## Module: map-detector

This TypeScript `MapDetector` class enables Battlefield Portal experience developers to detect the current map by analyzing the coordinates of Team 1's Headquarters (HQ). This utility is necessary because `mod.IsCurrentMap` from the official Battlefield Portal API is currently broken and unreliable.

### Example

```ts
import { MapDetector } from 'bf6-portal-utils/map-detector';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// If your experience uses custom spatial data that moves HQ1 on certain maps, set the
// expected HQ1 coordinates for each affected map here (after imports, not in an event handler).
MapDetector.setCoordinates(MapDetector.Map.Downtown, { x: -1044, y: 122, z: 220 });
MapDetector.setCoordinates(MapDetector.Map.Eastwood, { x: -195, y: 231, z: -41 });

Events.OnGameModeStarted.subscribe(() => {
    // Optional: Configure logging for map detection debugging
    MapDetector.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), MapDetector.LogLevel.Warning);

    // Get the current map as a MapDetector.Map enum
    const map = MapDetector.currentMap();

    if (map == MapDetector.Map.Downtown) {
        // Handle Downtown-specific logic
    }

    if (map == MapDetector.Map.Eastwood) {
        // Handle Eastwood-specific logic
    }

    // Get the current map as a string
    const mapName = MapDetector.currentMapName();
    console.log(`Current map: ${mapName}`);
});
```

## Supported Maps

The `MapDetector` namespace supports detection of the following maps via the `MapDetector.Map` enum:

- Area 22B
- Blackwell Fields
- Complex 3
- Contaminated
- Defense Nexus
- Downtown
- Eastwood
- Empire State
- Golf Course
- Hagental Base
- Iberian Offensive
- Liberation Peak
- Manhattan Bridge
- Marina
- Mirak Valley
- New Sobek City
- Operation Firestorm
- Portal Sandbox
- Redline Storage
- Saints Quarter
- Siege of Cairo

---

## Custom map spatial layouts

If your experience uses **custom spatial data** that moves Team 1's HQ from its default position on one or more maps, detection would otherwise fail. Call **`MapDetector.setCoordinates(map, coordinates)`** for **each map** where HQ1 has a non-default position. Do this **at the top of your file** (after imports), **not** inside an event handler—your code does not know the current map until the detector runs, so you must pre-configure every map whose layout you have changed. Pass the (x, y, z) position of HQ1 for that layout; only the **integer parts** of the coordinates are used when matching (decimal parts are ignored). That is sufficient because HQ positions differ widely between maps, so integer comparison is enough to distinguish them.

---

## Known Limitations

### Detection Method

The detector identifies maps by comparing the **integer parts** of Team 1's HQ position (x, y, z) to the known coordinates for each map; decimal parts are ignored. If custom spatial data has moved HQ1 on certain maps, call `setCoordinates()` at the top of your file for each affected map with the new HQ1 position so detection continues to work.

---

## Module: mod-extensions

The Battlefield Portal runtime injects a documented `mod` namespace. Some additional APIs exist at runtime but are not on the default type declarations. The `ModExtensions` namespace wraps those behind typed helpers and provides additional helpers for common tasks: event type comparisons (damage, death, gadget, weapon) and runtime string lookup, without casting `mod` yourself.

### Example

```ts
import { ModExtensions } from 'bf6-portal-utils/mod-extensions';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

Events.OnPlayerDied.subscribe((event: mod.OnPlayerDiedEvent) => {
    if (ModExtensions.isDeathType(event.deathType, mod.PlayerDeathTypes.Headshot)) {
        // Headshot-specific logic
    }
});

const label = ModExtensions.getString('gameMode.hud.section.label');
```

---

## Module: multi-click-detector

This TypeScript `MultiClickDetector` class enables Battlefield Portal experience developers to detect when a player has rapidly triggered a soldier state multiple times in quick succession. The detector can monitor any soldier state boolean from `mod.SoldierStateBool`, allowing you to detect multi-click sequences for various player actions.

The detector tracks soldier state transitions for each player independently, counting rapid state changes within a configurable time window to determine when a multi-click sequence has been completed. Each detector instance is configured with runtime options (including which soldier state to monitor) and a callback that is triggered when a multi-click sequence is detected.

By default, the detector monitors `mod.SoldierStateBool.IsInteracting`, which is the most user-friendly option because the interact state goes `true` for 1 tick even when there is no object that can be interacted with nearby. This makes it ideal for detecting multi-click sequences without requiring physical interaction points, and is useful because there is no keybind Portal experience developers can hook into to open up a custom UI.

Key features include instance-based construction with per-instance configuration, **automatic event wiring** via the `Events` module (the detector subscribes to `OngoingPlayer`, `OnPlayerDeployed`, `OnPlayerUndeploy`, and `OnPlayerLeaveGame` internally), and configurable logging. Soldier state is only read when the player is deployed, so the admin error log is not flooded. Each detector can be enabled or disabled independently. Callbacks can be sync or async; **asynchronous callbacks are preferred** because synchronous callbacks block the entire `OngoingPlayer` event stack. Keep sync callbacks short if you use them.

> **Note** You **must** use the `Events` module as your only mechanism to subscribe to game events. Do not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions (`OngoingPlayer`, `OnPlayerDeployed`, `OnPlayerDied`, etc.) in your code. The `Events` module subscribes to those events internally and only one implementation of each can exist per project, so it owns those hooks. See the [Events module — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).

### Example

```ts
import { MultiClickDetector } from 'bf6-portal-utils/multi-click-detector';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

MultiClickDetector.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), MultiClickDetector.LogLevel.Error);

Events.OnPlayerJoinGame.subscribe((player: mod.Player) => {
    const playerId = mod.GetObjId(player);

    // Create a detector for this player. Event wiring is automatic.
    // Prefer async callbacks—sync callbacks block the entire OngoingPlayer event stack.
    new MultiClickDetector(
        player,
        async () => {
            console.log(`Player ${playerId} performed multi-click!`);
            await openCustomMenu(player);
        },
        {
            soldierState: mod.SoldierStateBool.IsInteracting,
            windowMs: 1_000,
            requiredClicks: 3,
        }
    );
}
```

## Event Wiring & Lifecycle

### Event subscription (Events module only)

You must **not** implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions. The detector subscribes internally to `Events.OngoingPlayer`, `Events.OnPlayerDeployed`, `Events.OnPlayerUndeploy`, and `Events.OnPlayerLeaveGame`. Use the Events module for your own logic (e.g. `Events.OnPlayerJoinGame.subscribe(...)` to create detectors). There are no required event handlers for you to wire—event handling is automatic.

### Lifecycle Flow

1. Import `MultiClickDetector` and `Events`; subscribe to game events only via `Events`.
2. Optionally configure logging with `MultiClickDetector.setLogging()` (recommended during development).
3. Create detector instances for players in your event subscribers (e.g. `Events.OnPlayerJoinGame.subscribe((player) => { new MultiClickDetector(player, callback, options); })`). No need to call `handleOngoingPlayer` or `pruneInvalidPlayers`—the detector subscribes to the required events internally.
4. The module automatically:
    - Gates detector logic by deployment: soldier state is only read when the player is deployed (`OnPlayerDeployed` sets a player-level flag; `OnPlayerUndeploy` clears it). Each detector's own `enable()`/`disable()` state is **not** overwritten by deploy or undeploy.
    - Tracks soldier state transitions via `OngoingPlayer` (only for deployed players)
    - Removes all detectors for that player when they leave (`OnPlayerLeaveGame`)
    - For each enabled detector (when the player is deployed), counts state changes within the time window, resets sequences that exceed it, and invokes the callback (via `CallbackHandler`) when the required number of state changes is detected
5. You may call call `detector.destroy()` when you no longer need a specific detector; otherwise cleanup is automatic on player leave.

### Example: Multiple Detectors per Player

```ts
import { MultiClickDetector } from 'bf6-portal-utils/multi-click-detector';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

Events.OnPlayerJoinGame.subscribe((player: mod.Player) => {
    new MultiClickDetector(player, () => openCustomMenu(player), {
        soldierState: mod.SoldierStateBool.IsSprinting,
        requiredClicks: 4,
        windowMs: 1_500,
    });

    new MultiClickDetector(player, () => activateSpecialAbility(player), {
        soldierState: mod.SoldierStateBool.IsInteracting,
        requiredClicks: 3,
        windowMs: 1_000,
    });
});
```

### Example: Async callbacks (preferred)

```ts
import { MultiClickDetector } from 'bf6-portal-utils/multi-click-detector';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe((player: mod.Player) => {
    new MultiClickDetector(player, async () => {
        await loadPlayerData(player);
        await openCustomUI(player);
    });
});
```

## Choosing a Soldier State

The detector can monitor any soldier state boolean from `mod.SoldierStateBool`, but not all states are equally suitable for multi-click detection. This section explains which states work best and why.

### Recommended: `IsInteracting` (Default)

**Why it's the best choice:**

- **No visual side effects** – When a player rapidly presses the interact key, the interact state goes `true` for 1 ticks even when there is no object or interaction points that can be interacted with nearby. This means players can perform multi-click sequences without any visual feedback or character movement, making it feel like a hidden input method.
- **No gameplay impact** – Unlike other states, rapid interact presses don't cause the player's character to perform any actions that could interfere with gameplay.
- **Caveat** - Players must have their `Interact` keybind set to `Tap`, not `Hold`.

**Use case:** Opening custom menus, triggering special abilities, or any action where you want a hidden input method that doesn't affect the player's character visually or mechanically.

### Secondary Options: `IsCrouching` and `IsSprinting`

**Why they work but have drawbacks:**

- **Rapid toggling is possible** – Both `IsCrouching` and `IsSprinting` can be rapidly toggled by players, making them technically viable for multi-click detection.
- **Visual jittering** – Rapidly toggling these states causes the player's character to visually jitter as it tries to crouch/stand or sprint/walk in quick succession. This can be distracting and may interfere with gameplay.
- **Gameplay impact** – The character actually performs these actions, which may not be desirable if you're just trying to detect input for a UI or special ability.
- **Benefit** - Unlike requiring players to ensure their `Interact` keybind set to `Tap`, it is more likely players can already quickly toggle `Sprint` or `Crouch` with their existing keybind settings.

**Use case:** Consider these if you need more than one multi-click detection (and you've already used the `IsInteracting` state), or if you are comfortable forcing players to physically jitter a bit, but not have to change their `Interact` keybind set to `Tap`.

- **Memory** – Detectors for a player are removed automatically when the player leaves. Hold a detector reference only if you need to call `enable()`, `disable()`, or `destroy()` yourself; otherwise you can create detectors without storing the return value.

## Module: performance-stats

The `PerformanceStats` namespace tracks server tick rate and script timeout lag and exposes getters suitable for real-time compute scaling or displaying smoothed metrics in a UI. When the game mode starts, it subscribes to `Events.OngoingGlobal` to measure inter-tick timing and starts a 1-second sampling window to compute smoothed tick rate (Hz) and lag (ms). When the server is under stress—e.g. timeout lag spikes over 100ms or tick rate drops below 25Hz—it logs warnings via the configured logger so you can see spikes in the UI or logs without polling raw values yourself.

### Example

```ts
import { PerformanceStats } from 'bf6-portal-utils/performance-stats';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

// Optional: show spike warnings in UI or console
PerformanceStats.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), PerformanceStats.LogLevel.Warning);

Events.OnGameModeStarted.subscribe(() => {
    // Periodic UI update with smoothed metrics (stable for display)
    Timers.setInterval(() => {
        const hz = PerformanceStats.getSmoothedTickRate();
        const lagMs = PerformanceStats.getSmoothedTimeoutLagMs();
        updatePerformancePanel(hz, lagMs);
    }, 1_000);
});

// Scale expensive logic when the server is bogged down
Events.OngoingPlayer.subscribe((player: mod.Player) => {
    const health = PerformanceStats.getSpotHealthFactor();
    if (health < 0.8) {
        // Reduce check frequency or skip non-critical work
        return;
    }
    doExpensivePerPlayerWork(player);
});
```

## Module: player-undeploy-fixer

The `PlayerUndeployFixer` namespace is a small helper that automatically subscribes to `OnPlayerDied`, `OnPlayerUndeploy`, and `OnPlayerLeaveGame` via the `Events` module. It tracks whether a player who died has properly undeployed within a fixed time window (currently 30 seconds). If not—e.g. the player is stuck in a "limbo" state where the engine did not fire `OnPlayerUndeploy`—the fixer manually triggers `Events.OnPlayerUndeploy.trigger(player)` so that any code subscribed to `OnPlayerUndeploy` runs correctly. This fix is mainly useful in handling static AI bots that do not properly undeploy when they die, which, when left unchecked, results in a slowly growing population of stuck AI that never redeploy.

No setup is required beyond importing the module; subscribing and triggering are handled internally.

> **Note** You **must** use the `Events` module as your only mechanism to subscribe to game events. Do not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions (`OnPlayerDied`, `OnPlayerUndeploy`, `OnPlayerDeployed`, etc.) in your code. The `Events` module owns those hooks and this module relies on it; only one implementation of each event handler can exist per project. See the [Events module — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).

### Example

```ts
import { PlayerUndeployFixer } from 'bf6-portal-utils/player-undeploy-fixer';

// Optional: log when the fixer forces an undeploy
PlayerUndeployFixer.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), PlayerUndeployFixer.LogLevel.Warning);
```

## Known Limitations & Caveats

- **Events module required** – Since this module uses the `Events` module, you **must** use the [Events module](../events/README.md) for all game event subscription and **must not** implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions. See [Events — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).
- **Fixed delay** – The time window before forcing an undeploy is currently a fixed 30 seconds and is not configurable via the public API.
- **Trigger semantics** – When the fixer calls `Events.OnPlayerUndeploy.trigger(player)`, all subscribers to `OnPlayerUndeploy` are invoked. Ensure your subscriber can safely run when the player is in the "stuck" state (e.g. not assuming the player is on the deploy screen in the usual way).

---

## Module: raycast

This TypeScript `Raycast` namespace abstracts the raycasting functionality of BF6 Portal and handles attributing raycast hits and misses to the correct raycasts created, since the native functionality does not do this. It subscribes to `OnRayCastHit` and `OnRayCastMissed` via the `Events` module at load time, so hit and miss events are routed automatically—no manual event wiring is required. You pass hit and miss callbacks when calling `Raycast.cast()`, which keeps code readable and modular.

The namespace tracks active rays per player, uses geometric distance calculations to match hit points to ray segments, and automatically handles cleanup of expired rays and player states. A time-to-live (TTL) system ensures that old rays don't accumulate in memory, and a sophisticated pending misses resolution system correctly attributes misses to rays when the native API provides ambiguous information. The module uses the `Logging` module for internal logging, allowing you to monitor callback errors and debug raycast behavior.

> **Note** Since this module uses the `Events` module for `OnRayCastHit` and `OnRayCastMissed`, you **must** use the `Events` module as your only mechanism to subscribe to game events. Do not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions (`OnRayCastHit`, `OnRayCastMissed`, `OnPlayerDeployed`, etc.) in your code. The `Events` module owns those hooks and this module relies on it; only one implementation of each event handler can exist per project. See the [Events module — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).

### Example

```ts
import { Raycast } from 'bf6-portal-utils/raycast';
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';

// Optional: Configure logging for raycast callback error monitoring
Raycast.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Raycast.LogLevel.Error);

// Raycast subscribes to OnRayCastHit and OnRayCastMissed via Events automatically.
// Use Events for your own logic (e.g. when to cast a ray).
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe((eventPlayer: mod.Player) => {
    const playerPosition = mod.GetSoldierState(eventPlayer, mod.SoldierStateVector.GetPosition);

    // Cast a ray from the player's position forward to detect obstacles
    const forwardDirection = mod.GetSoldierState(eventPlayer, mod.SoldierStateVector.GetDirection);
    const rayEnd = mod.VectorAdd(playerPosition, mod.VectorScale(forwardDirection, 100));

    Raycast.cast(
        eventPlayer,
        {
            x: mod.XComponentOf(playerPosition),
            y: mod.YComponentOf(playerPosition),
            z: mod.ZComponentOf(playerPosition),
        },
        {
            x: mod.XComponentOf(rayEnd),
            y: mod.YComponentOf(rayEnd),
            z: mod.ZComponentOf(rayEnd),
        },
        {
            onHit: async (hitPoint, normal) => {
                // Called when the ray hits a target
                // Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (return void or Promise<void>)
                console.log(`Ray hit at <${hitPoint.x}, ${hitPoint.y}, ${hitPoint.z}>`);
                console.log(`Surface normal: <${normal.x}, ${normal.y}, ${normal.z}>`);
            },
            onMiss: () => {
                // Called when the ray misses (no target found)
                // Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (return void or Promise<void>)
                console.log('Ray missed - no obstacle detected');
            },
        }
    );
});
```

## Usage Patterns

- **Obstacle Detection** – Cast rays from players to detect walls, terrain, or other obstacles ahead of them.
- **Line of Sight Checks** – Verify if a player has line of sight to another player or target.
- **Weapon Targeting** – Use raycasts to determine where a weapon shot would hit before actually firing.
- **Spawn Point Validation** – Check if a potential spawn location is clear of obstacles before spawning a player.
- **Interactive Objects** – Detect what objects a player is looking at or pointing at for interaction systems.

### Example: Line of Sight Check

Note: This example is not technically a sufficient LOS check implementation as it does not correctly use the player's eye position, nor does it take into account if the target is without a cone of view of the player's eye direction.

```ts
import { Raycast } from 'bf6-portal-utils/raycast';

function checkLineOfSight(player: mod.Player, target: mod.Player): Promise<boolean> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        const playerPos = mod.GetSoldierState(player, mod.SoldierStateVector.GetPosition);
        const targetPos = mod.GetSoldierState(target, mod.SoldierStateVector.GetPosition);

        Raycast.cast(player, playerPos, targetPos, {
            onHit: async (hitPoint) => {
                // Ray hit something - check if it's the target (within 1 meter)
                // Since we passed mod.Vector for start/end, hitPoint is also mod.Vector
                // Callbacks can be async (return Promise<void>) or sync (return void)
                const dx = mod.XComponentOf(hitPoint) - mod.XComponentOf(targetPos);
                const dy = mod.YComponentOf(hitPoint) - mod.YComponentOf(targetPos);
                const dz = mod.ZComponentOf(hitPoint) - mod.ZComponentOf(targetPos);
                const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy + dz * dz);

                // If hit point is close to target, we have line of sight
                resolve(distance < 1.0);
            },
            onMiss: () => {
                // Ray missed - no line of sight (obstacle or ray expired)
                // Callbacks can be async (return Promise<void>) or sync (return void)
                resolve(false);
            },
        });
    });
}
```

## Known Limitations & Caveats

- **Events module required** – You **must** use the [Events module](../events/README.md) for all game event subscription and **must not** implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions. This module subscribes to `OnRayCastHit` and `OnRayCastMissed` via Events. See [Events — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).

- **Multiple Simultaneous Rays** – The module can handle multiple rays from the same player, but if many rays are cast in quick succession, the geometric attribution algorithm may become less efficient. In practice, this is rarely an issue since the linear scan is very fast for small ray counts.

- **Miss Attribution Ambiguity** – The native API doesn't distinguish which specific ray missed, so the module uses a counting heuristic. In rare cases with many simultaneous rays, misses may be attributed slightly later than ideal, but they will always be correctly resolved.

- **TTL Precision** – Expired rays trigger their miss callbacks after the TTL expires, not at the exact expiration time. The actual cleanup happens during pruning operations (every 5 seconds) or lazy pruning (before adding new rays).

- **Callback Errors** – Callback errors (both synchronous and asynchronous) are automatically caught and logged (if logging is configured via `Raycast.setLogging()`) to prevent one failing callback from breaking the entire raycast system. Errors are logged at the `Error` log level. If you need additional error handling, implement it inside your callbacks.

- **Player State Cleanup** – While automatic pruning runs every 5 seconds, you may call `Raycast.pruneAllStates()` from a handler subscribed to `Events.OnPlayerLeaveGame` to immediately clean up state when players leave.

- **Distance Epsilon** – The hit attribution uses a 0.5m (`_DISTANCE_EPSILON`) sanity cap for distance comparisons. The algorithm finds the best-fitting ray (lowest error) among all candidates, and only considers rays where the error is within this tolerance. This acts as a sanity check to prevent misattribution rather than a strict matching threshold.

## Module: scavenger-drop

This TypeScript `ScavengerDrop` class provides functionality for Battlefield Portal experiences to detect when a player scavenges a dead player's kit bag. In Battlefield 6, when a player dies, they drop a bag containing their kit that despawns after approximately 37 seconds. Players can pick up weapons from these bags, but the default behavior does not replenish the scavenging player's ammo. This module allows you to perform custom actions (such as resupplying ammo, displaying messages, or any other logic) when the first player gets within 2 meters of a dead player's body.

**Why use ScavengerDrop?** The `ScavengerDrop` module offers significant advantages: automatic detection of players scavenging dead bodies, performance-optimized checking that scales frequency based on proximity, support for custom callbacks to handle scavenging events, and automatic cleanup when drops expire or are scavenged. Ideal for ammo resupply systems, custom loot mechanics, achievement tracking, or any scenario where you need to detect and respond to players picking up dropped kits.

Key features include adaptive check frequency that increases as players get closer to drops (reducing overhead when drops are far away), automatic expiration after the configured duration (defaulting to 37 seconds to match the game's bag despawn time), graceful error handling that prevents callback failures from crashing your mod, and configurable logging for debugging scavenger drop behavior. The module uses the `Timers` module for interval management and the `Logging` module for internal logging.

### Example

```ts
import { ScavengerDrop } from 'bf6-portal-utils/scavenger-drop';

// Optional: Configure logging for scavenger drop monitoring
ScavengerDrop.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), ScavengerDrop.LogLevel.Info);

export function OnPlayerDied(
    victim: mod.Player,
    killer: mod.Player,
    deathType: mod.DeathType,
    weapon: mod.WeaponUnlock
): void {
    // Create a scavenger drop that triggers when a player gets within 2 meters
    // Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (return void or Promise<void>)
    new ScavengerDrop(victim, (scavenger: mod.Player) => {
        // Resupply the scavenger's primary weapon magazine ammo
        mod.SetInventoryMagazineAmmo(
            scavenger,
            mod.InventorySlots.PrimaryWeapon,
            mod.GetInventoryMagazineAmmo(scavenger, mod.InventorySlots.PrimaryWeapon) + 30
        );

        // Display a message to the scavenger
        mod.DisplayHighlightedWorldLogMessage(mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.scavengerLog), scavenger); // 'Scavenged ammo'
    });
}
```

## Usage Patterns

- **Basic ammo resupply** – Use `mod.Resupply()` in the callback to give players full ammo when they scavenge a kit.
- **Custom ammo management** – Use `mod.SetInventoryAmmo()` and `mod.SetInventoryMagazineAmmo()` for fine-grained ammo control.
- **Player notifications** – Use `mod.DisplayHighlightedWorldLogMessage()` to inform players when they scavenge a kit.
- **Kill Confirmed** – Spawn an item on the dead body and give points to the player or team that confirms the kill.
- **Achievement tracking** – Track scavenging events for statistics or achievements.
- **Custom loot systems** – Implement custom loot mechanics beyond the default kit bag behavior.
- **Drop cleanup** – Use `stop()` to manually cancel drops when needed (e.g., if a player respawns before the drop expires).

### Example: Custom Duration and Check Interval and Async Callback Handling

```ts
import { ScavengerDrop } from 'bf6-portal-utils/scavenger-drop';

export function OnPlayerDied(
    victim: mod.Player,
    killer: mod.Player,
    deathType: mod.DeathType,
    weapon: mod.WeaponUnlock
): void {
    // Create a drop that lasts 20 seconds with checks every 100ms if a player is nearby.
    new ScavengerDrop(
        victim,
        async (scavenger: mod.Player) => {
            // Perform async operations
            await someAsyncOperation();

            mod.Resupply(scavenger, mod.ResupplyTypes.AmmoBox);

            // Log to external service, update statistics, etc.
            await logScavengeEvent(scavenger, victim);
        },
        {
            duration: 20_000, // 20 seconds
            checkInterval: 100, // 100ms base check interval
        }
    );
}
```

## Known Limitations & Caveats

- **Position Capture** – The drop captures the position of the dead player's body at creation time. If the body moves (e.g., due to physics or explosions), the drop will continue checking the original position. Always create the drop immediately in `OnPlayerDied` to ensure the position is accurate.

- **Single Trigger** – Each drop triggers its callback only once—when the first player gets within 2 meters. If multiple players are close when the check occurs, only the closest player triggers the callback. If you need to handle multiple scavengers, create multiple drops or implement custom logic in your callback.

- **Distance Precision** – The 2-meter threshold is fixed and cannot be configured. The threshold matches typical interaction ranges in Battlefield Portal that feel reasonable and ergonomic.

- **Check Interval Precision** – The actual check frequency adapts based on player proximity, but the base `checkInterval` determines the minimum time between checks. Timer precision depends on `mod.Wait()`'s precision (used by the `Timers` module), which may vary slightly based on game performance and frame timing.

- **Performance Considerations** – While the adaptive check frequency reduces overhead, creating many drops simultaneously (e.g., during intense combat with many deaths) will still create multiple interval timers. The module is optimized for typical gameplay scenarios, but extreme cases with hundreds of concurrent drops may impact performance.

- **Async Callbacks** – Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (returning `void` or `Promise<void>`). Async callbacks are not awaited by the drop, meaning:
    - The drop doesn't wait for async operations to complete before cleaning up
    - Errors or rejections from async callbacks are automatically caught and logged (if logging is configured)
    - If you need to await async operations, handle that inside your callback

- **Concurrent Drops** – Multiple drops can exist simultaneously and operate independently. Each drop maintains its own timers and state. There is no built-in limit on the number of concurrent drops.

## Module: solid-ui

This TypeScript `SolidUI` namespace provides a reactive UI framework for Battlefield Portal, inspired by [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid). Unlike traditional frameworks that re-render entire components, `SolidUI` uses fine-grained reactivity to update only the specific UI properties that change, resulting in minimal overhead and maximum performance.

`SolidUI` is a from-scratch implementation of reactive primitives (signals, effects, memos, stores) adapted for the Battlefield Portal environment. It uses a HyperScript-like factory function (`h`) instead of JSX/TSX, and integrates seamlessly with the [`UI`](../ui/README.md) module to create dynamic, reactive user interfaces. The module uses the `Logging` module for internal logging, allowing you to monitor effect errors and debug reactive system behavior.

> **Note** The `SolidUI` namespace is decoupled from the `UI` module but has been designed and tested with it. It assumes that UI objects have getters and setters for properties that need to be reactive.

### Example

**File: `src/index.ts`**

```ts
import { SolidUI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/solid-ui';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Optional: Configure logging for reactive system error monitoring
SolidUI.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), SolidUI.LogLevel.Error);

function createCounterUI(player: mod.Player): void {
    // Create a reactive signal
    const [count, setCount] = SolidUI.createSignal(0);

    // Create a container with reactive visibility
    const container = SolidUI.h(
        UI.Container,
        {
            width: 200,
            height: 100,
            bgColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
            bgAlpha: 0.8,
            visible: true,
        },
        player
    );

    // Create text that updates when count changes
    SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
        parent: container,
        message: () => mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.count, count()), // Accessor function
        textSize: 30,
        textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
    });

    // Create a button that increments the count
    SolidUI.h(UI.TextButton, {
        parent: container,
        y: 50,
        width: 150,
        height: 40,
        message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.increment),
        onClick: async () => {
            setCount((c) => c + 1); // Update signal
        },
    });
}
```

**File: `src/strings.json`**

```json
{
    "count": "Count: {}",
    "increment": "Increment"
}
```

**Example:**

```ts
const [count, setCount] = SolidUI.createSignal(0);

// Read the value (subscribes if called inside an effect or reactive property)
console.log(count()); // 0

// Update with a value
setCount(5);

// Update with a function (receives previous value)
setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
```

**Usage in UI:**

```ts
const [isVisible, setVisible] = SolidUI.createSignal(false);

const container = SolidUI.h(UI.Container, {
    visible: isVisible, // Pass the accessor directly
    width: 200,
    height: 100,
});

// Later, update the signal
setVisible(true); // Container becomes visible automatically
```

**Example:**

```ts
const [count, setCount] = SolidUI.createSignal(0);

// Effect runs immediately and whenever count changes
const dispose = SolidUI.createEffect(() => {
    console.log(`Count is now: ${count()}`);
});

setCount(5); // Logs: "Count is now: 5"
setCount(10); // Logs: "Count is now: 10"

// Stop the effect
dispose();
```

**Note:** Effects created inside `SolidUI.h()` are automatically cleaned up when the UI element is deleted. You typically don't need to manually dispose of them unless creating standalone effects.

**Example:**

```ts
const [firstName, setFirstName] = SolidUI.createSignal('John');
const [lastName, setLastName] = SolidUI.createSignal('Doe');

// Create a memoized full name
const fullName = SolidUI.createMemo(() => `${firstName()} ${lastName()}`);

console.log(fullName()); // "John Doe"

setFirstName('Jane');
console.log(fullName()); // "Jane Doe" (automatically recomputed)
```

**Usage in UI:**

```ts
const [health, setHealth] = SolidUI.createSignal(100);
const [maxHealth, setMaxHealth] = SolidUI.createSignal(100);

const healthPercent = SolidUI.createMemo(() => (health() / maxHealth()) * 100);

SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
    message: () => mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.healthPercent, healthPercent().toFixed(1)),
    // Only recomputes when health or maxHealth changes
});
```

```json
{
    "healthPercent": "{}%"
}
```

**Example:**

```ts
const [state, setState] = SolidUI.createStore({
    user: {
        name: 'John',
        age: 30,
    },
    settings: {
        theme: 'dark',
    },
});

// Read values (automatically tracks which properties you access)
console.log(state.user.name); // "John"

// Update values using the setter
setState((s) => {
    s.user.name = 'Jane'; // Only effects reading user.name will run
});

// Update nested properties
setState((s) => {
    s.settings.theme = 'light'; // Only effects reading settings.theme will run
});
```

**Usage in UI:**

```ts
const [uiState, setUIState] = SolidUI.createStore({
    isVisible: false,
    counter: {
        value: 0,
        increment: 1,
    },
});

const container = SolidUI.h(UI.Container, {
    visible: () => uiState.isVisible, // Tracks isVisible property
    width: 200,
    height: 100,
});

SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
    parent: container,
    message: () => mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.value, uiState.counter.value), // Tracks counter.value
});

// Update the store
setUIState((s) => {
    s.isVisible = true; // Only container visibility updates
    s.counter.value = 5; // Only text message updates
});
```

```json
{
    "value": "Value: {}"
}
```

**Example:**

```ts
// Create a theme context
const ThemeContext = SolidUI.createContext<'light' | 'dark'>('light');

// Provide a theme value
ThemeContext.provide('dark', () => {
    // All useContext(ThemeContext) calls inside this scope return 'dark'
    const container = SolidUI.h(UI.Container, {
        bgColor: () => {
            const theme = SolidUI.useContext(ThemeContext);
            return theme === 'dark' ? UI.COLORS.BLACK : UI.COLORS.WHITE;
        },
    });
});

// Use the context
const theme = SolidUI.useContext(ThemeContext); // Returns 'dark' if inside provide, 'light' otherwise
```

**Example:**

```ts
const [count, setCount] = SolidUI.createSignal(0);
const [timer, setTimer] = SolidUI.createSignal(0);

SolidUI.createEffect(() => {
    console.log(count()); // Tracks 'count'
    SolidUI.untrack(() => {
        console.log(timer()); // Logs 'timer' but doesn't track it
        // This effect won't re-run when timer changes
    });
});
```

**Example:**

```ts
SolidUI.h(
    UI.Container,
    {
        // ... props
    },
    player
);

// Inside the component setup (if using functional components):
SolidUI.onCleanup(() => {
    // This runs when the container is deleted
    console.log('Container cleaned up');
});
```

**Note:** Cleanup functions registered via `onCleanup` inside `SolidUI.h()` are automatically called when the UI element's `delete()` method is invoked.

**How Reactivity Works:**

1. When you pass a function as a property value, `SolidUI.h()` treats it as an accessor
2. It reads the initial value to set up the UI element
3. It creates an effect that watches the accessor
4. When the accessor's value changes, it updates only that specific property

**Example with Signals:**

```ts
const [count, setCount] = SolidUI.createSignal(0);
const [isVisible, setVisible] = SolidUI.createSignal(true);

const container = SolidUI.h(UI.Container, {
    visible: isVisible, // Reactive: updates when isVisible changes
    width: 200,
    height: 100,
    bgColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
});

SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
    parent: container,
    message: () => mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.count, count()), // Reactive: updates when count changes
    textSize: 30,
});
```

```json
{
    "count": "Count: {}"
}
```

**Example with Stores:**

```ts
const [state, setState] = SolidUI.createStore({
    health: 100,
    color: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
});

SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
    message: () => mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.health, state.message), // Tracks state.health
    textColor: () => state.color, // Tracks state.color
    textSize: 30,
});
```

```json
{
    "health": "Health: {}"
}
```

**Example with Functional Components:**

```ts
function MyButton(props: { team: number; onClick: () => void }) {
    return SolidUI.h(UI.TextButton, {
        message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.switchTeams, team),
        onClick: props.onClick,
        width: 200,
        height: 40,
    });
}

// Use the functional component
SolidUI.h(MyButton, {
    team: 1,
    onClick: async () => {
        console.log('Clicked!');
        mod.SetTeam(thisPlayer, mod.GetTeam(1));
    },
});
```

```json
{
    "switchTeams": "Switch to team {}"
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- Properties that are functions are automatically made reactive
- Properties that match the pattern `on[A-Z]` (start with lowercase "on" followed by an uppercase letter) are never made reactive and are always passed through as-is. This includes event handlers like `onClickUp`, `onFocusIn`, `onDelete`, etc., but excludes properties like `onlyOnce`, `once`, or `online`
- All reactive effects are automatically cleaned up when the UI element is deleted
- You can mix static and reactive properties in the same props object

**Example:**

```ts
const [items, setItems] = SolidUI.createSignal([
    { id: 1, name: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.team1) },
    { id: 2, name: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.team2) },
    { id: 3, name: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.team3) },
]);

const container = SolidUI.h(UI.Container, {
    width: 300,
    height: 400,
});

// Render a list of items
SolidUI.Index(
    items, // Accessor to the array
    (item, index) => {
        // item() returns the current value at this index
        // index is a static number (0, 1, 2, ...)
        return SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
            parent: container,
            y: index * 50, // Position based on index
            message: () => item().name, // Reactive: updates when this item changes
            textSize: 24,
        });
    }
);

// Update the array
setItems([
    { id: 2, name: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.team2Up) }, // Widget at index 0 updates
    { id: 1, name: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.team1) }, // Widget at index 1 updates
    // Widget at index 2 is disposed (array shrunk)
]);

// Add new items
setItems((prev) => [
    ...prev,
    { id: 4, name: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.team4) }, // New widget created at index 3
]);
```

```json
{
    "item1": "Item 1",
    "item2": "Item 2",
    "item3": "Item 3",
    "item4": "Item 4",
    "item2Up": "Item 2 Updated"
}
```

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Reactive UI

The simplest pattern: create signals and pass them as property values.

```ts
function createBasicUI(player: mod.Player): void {
    const [count, setCount] = SolidUI.createSignal(0);

    const container = SolidUI.h(
        UI.Container,
        {
            width: 200,
            height: 150,
            bgColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
            bgAlpha: 0.8,
        },
        player
    );

    SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
        parent: container,
        message: () => mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.count, count()),
        textSize: 30,
        textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
    });

    SolidUI.h(UI.TextButton, {
        parent: container,
        y: 50,
        width: 150,
        height: 40,
        message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.increment),
        onClick: async () => setCount((c) => c + 1),
    });
}
```

```json
{
    "count": "Count: {}",
    "increment": "Increment"
}
```

### Conditional Visibility

Use signals to control visibility and other conditional properties.

```ts
function createModalUI(player: mod.Player): void {
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = SolidUI.createSignal(false);

    const modal = SolidUI.h(
        UI.Container,
        {
            visible: isOpen, // Reactive visibility
            uiInputModeWhenVisible: true, // Automatically manages input mode
            width: 400,
            height: 300,
            bgColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
            bgAlpha: 0.9,
            bgFill: mod.UIBgFill.Blur,
        },
        player
    );

    SolidUI.h(UI.TextButton, {
        parent: modal,
        y: 120,
        width: 200,
        height: 50,
        message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.close),
        onClick: async () => setIsOpen(false),
    });

    // Function to toggle the modal visibility
    return () => setIsOpen(!isOpen());
}
```

```json
{
    "close": "Close"
}
```

### Derived State with Memos

Use memos to compute values that depend on multiple signals.

```ts
function createHealthBar(player: mod.Player): void {
    const [health, setHealth] = SolidUI.createSignal(100);
    const [maxHealth, setMaxHealth] = SolidUI.createSignal(100);

    // Compute health percentage
    const healthPercent = SolidUI.createMemo(() => (health() / maxHealth()) * 100);

    // Compute health color (red when low, green when high)
    const healthColor = SolidUI.createMemo(() => {
        const percent = healthPercent();
        if (percent < 25) return UI.COLORS.RED;
        if (percent < 50) return UI.COLORS.YELLOW;
        return UI.COLORS.GREEN;
    });

    const container = SolidUI.h(
        UI.Container,
        {
            width: 200,
            height: 20,
            bgColor: UI.COLORS.BF_GREY_3,
            bgAlpha: 0.8,
        },
        player
    );

    // Health bar (width based on percentage)
    SolidUI.h(UI.Container, {
        parent: container,
        width: () => healthPercent(), // Reactive width
        height: 20,
        bgColor: healthColor, // Reactive color
        bgAlpha: 1,
    });

    // Health text
    SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
        parent: container,
        message: () => mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.health, health(), maxHealth()),
        textSize: 16,
        textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
    });
}
```

```json
{
    "health": "{} / {}"
}
```

### Complex State with Stores

Use stores for nested state that needs fine-grained reactivity.

```ts
type GameState = {
    player: {
        name: string;
        score: number;
    };
    ui: {
        isMenuOpen: boolean;
        selectedTab: string;
    };
};

function createGameUI(player: mod.Player): void {
    const [state, setState] = SolidUI.createStore<GameState>({
        player: {
            name: 'Player',
            score: 0,
        },
        ui: {
            isMenuOpen: false,
            selectedTab: 'stats',
        },
    });

    // Menu container (only tracks ui.isMenuOpen)
    const menu = SolidUI.h(
        UI.Container,
        {
            visible: () => state.ui.isMenuOpen,
            width: 400,
            height: 500,
            bgColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
            bgAlpha: 0.9,
        },
        player
    );

    // Score display (only tracks player.score)
    SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
        parent: menu,
        message: () => mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.score, state.player.score),
        textSize: 30,
        textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
    });

    // Update only specific properties
    setState((s) => {
        s.player.score += 10; // Only score text updates
    });

    setState((s) => {
        s.ui.isMenuOpen = true; // Only menu visibility updates
    });
}
```

```json
{
    "score": "Score: {}"
}
```

### Dynamic Lists

Use `Index` to render lists that update efficiently.

```ts
type PlayerScore = {
    id: number;
    player: mod.Player;
    score: number;
};

function createScoreboard(player: mod.Player): void {
    const [scores, setScores] = SolidUI.createSignal<PlayerScore[]>([]);

    const container = SolidUI.h(
        UI.Container,
        {
            width: 300,
            height: 400,
            bgColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
            bgAlpha: 0.8,
        },
        player
    );

    // Render the list
    SolidUI.Index(scores, (playerScore, index) => {
        return SolidUI.h(UI.Text, {
            parent: container,
            y: index * 30, // Position based on index
            message: () => {
                const playerScore = playerScore();
                return mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.score, playerScore.player, playerScore.score);
            },
            textSize: 20,
            textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
        });
    });

    // Update the list (Assume player1, player2, and player3 are some valid `mod.Player` objects)
    setScores([
        { id: 1, player: player1, score: 100 },
        { id: 2, player: player2, score: 85 },
        { id: 3, player: player3, score: 120 },
    ]);

    // Sort and update (widgets stay in place, content updates)
    setScores((prev) => [...prev].sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score));
}
```

```json
{
    "score": "{}: {}"
}
```

### Real-World Example: Spawn UI

This example is based on the [`FFASpawning`](../ffa-spawning/index.ts) module, demonstrating a complete reactive UI system.

```ts
function createSpawnUI(player: mod.Player): void {
    const [delayCountdown, setDelayCountdown] = SolidUI.createSignal(-1);

    // Prompt container (visible when countdown reaches 0)
    const promptUI = SolidUI.h(
        UI.Container,
        {
            x: 0,
            y: 0,
            width: 440,
            height: 140,
            anchor: mod.UIAnchor.Center,
            visible: () => delayCountdown() === 0,
            uiInputModeWhenVisible: true, // Automatically manages input mode
            bgColor: UI.COLORS.BF_GREY_4,
            bgAlpha: 0.5,
            bgFill: mod.UIBgFill.Blur,
        },
        player
    );

    // Spawn button
    SolidUI.h(UI.TextButton, {
        parent: promptUI,
        y: 20,
        width: 400,
        height: 40,
        anchor: mod.UIAnchor.TopCenter,
        message: mod.Message('Spawn now'),
        textSize: 30,
        textColor: UI.COLORS.BF_GREEN_BRIGHT,
        onClick: async () => {
            // Spawn logic here
            setDelayCountdown(-1);
        },
    });

    // Countdown text (visible when countdown > 0)
    SolidUI.h(
        UI.Text,
        {
            x: 0,
            y: 60,
            width: 400,
            height: 50,
            anchor: mod.UIAnchor.TopCenter,
            message: () => mod.Message(`Spawning available in ${delayCountdown()} seconds...`),
            textSize: 30,
            textColor: UI.COLORS.BF_GREEN_BRIGHT,
            visible: () => delayCountdown() > 0,
        },
        player
    );

    // Start the countdown (a timer calls `setDelayCountdown` every second, which automatically updates the UI).
    setDelayCountdown(10);
}
```

**Example:**

```ts
function MyButton(props: { team: number; onClick: () => void }) {
    return SolidUI.h(UI.TextButton, {
        message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.switchTeams, props.team),
        onClick: props.onClick,
        width: 200,
        height: 40,
    });
}

// MyButton is a FunctionalComponent<{ team: number; onClick: () => void }, TextButtonInstance>
SolidUI.h(MyButton, {
    team: 1,
    onClick: async () => {
        console.log('Clicked!');
    },
});
```

**Note:** Functional components receive props where values can be either static values or accessor functions (signals). The component can call accessors to get reactive values, but the props themselves are not automatically unwrapped.

## Known Limitations & Caveats

### UI Module Dependency

While `SolidUI` is decoupled from the `UI` module, it assumes that UI objects have getters and setters for properties. It has only been tested with the `UI` module. Using it with other UI systems may require adaptation.

### Property Assignment

`SolidUI.h()` uses property setters to update UI elements. If a property is read-only or doesn't have a setter, updates will fail silently (errors are caught). Ensure your UI objects have proper setters for reactive properties.

### Accessor Function Detection

`SolidUI.h()` treats any function value as an accessor. If you need to pass a function as a static value (not reactive), you'll need to work around this. Properties that match the pattern `on[A-Z]` (start with lowercase "on" followed by an uppercase letter) are never made reactive. This includes event handlers like `onClickUp`, `onFocusIn`, `onDelete`, etc., but excludes properties like `onlyOnce`, `once`, or `online`.

### Store Updates

Store updates must use the `setStore` function with a producer. Direct assignment to store properties (e.g., `store.value = 5`) works but may not trigger reactivity correctly in all cases. Always use the setter:

```ts
// ✅ Correct
setStore((s) => {
    s.value = 5;
});

// ⚠️ May work but not recommended
store.value = 5;
```

### Effect Execution Order

Effects execute in the order they were scheduled, but there's no guarantee of execution order across different signals. If you need specific ordering, chain effects manually or use a single effect.

### Effect Error Handling

Effect errors are automatically caught and logged (if logging is configured via `SolidUI.setLogging()`) to prevent one failing effect from breaking the entire reactive system. Errors are logged at the `Error` log level. If you need additional error handling, implement it inside your effects.

### Memory Management

Effects and subscriptions are automatically cleaned up when UI elements are deleted. However, if you create standalone effects or roots, you must manually dispose of them to prevent memory leaks.

### Async Updates

All reactive updates are asynchronous. If you need synchronous updates (not recommended), you'll need to use the underlying `UI` module directly.

## Module: sounds

This TypeScript `Sounds` namespace wraps Battlefield Portal’s SFX workflow: it spawns `mod.SFX` objects, plays them in 2D or 3D with optional per-player, per-squad, or per-team routing, and supports timed playback, stepped fades, and cleanup. The module builds on the [`Timers`](../timers/README.md) module for delays and fades (Portal’s runtime has no native `setTimeout`), and uses the [`Logging`](../logging/README.md) module for optional play logging.

Use **`Sound2D`** for non-positional audio and **`Sound3D`** for world-positioned audio with attenuation. For fire-and-forget clips, call **`Sound2D.play()`** or **`Sound3D.play()`**, which return a **`stop`** function—keep it and call it when playback should end if you did not pass a finite **`duration`** (or a fade that ends with **`stopOnComplete`**) so the instance can **`dispose()`** and unspawn the SFX. For long-lived or manually controlled sounds, construct **`new Sound2D(...)`** or **`new Sound3D(...)`** and call **`play()`**, **`stop()`**, **`fade()`**, and **`dispose()`** as needed.

> **Resource leaks.** Each sound instance wraps a spawned **`mod.SFX`**. That object is only **`UnspawnObject`**’d when **`dispose()`** runs (directly or via the one-shot **`stop`** callback). If you **never** call **`dispose()`** on an instance you created, **never** call the **`stop`** function returned from **`Sound2D.play`** / **`Sound3D.play`**, and for a one-shot you **omit** **`duration`** and **do not** supply **`fadeOptions`** that imply a bounded end (e.g. **`stopOnComplete: true`** with a completing fade), the underlying SFX **stays spawned**—a **resource leak** for the rest of the match (or until the experience ends). Always tie cleanup to player leave, UI teardown, game phase changes, or a fixed **`duration`**.

> **Choosing `RuntimeSpawn_Common` SFX values.** In **`bf6-portal-mod-types`**, entries under **`mod.RuntimeSpawn_Common`** that are sound effects all use the **`SFX_`** prefix. For this module, pick names that match the playback mode: **`Sound3D`** expects assets whose names end with **`_SimpleLoop3D`** or **`_OneShot3D`**; **`Sound2D`** expects names ending with **`_SimpleLoop2D`** or **`_OneShot2D`**. Using the wrong variant can yield incorrect or silent behavior in-game.

### Example: one-shot with fixed duration

```ts
import { Sounds } from 'bf6-portal-utils/sounds';

// In your mod: `sfxAsset` is a `mod.RuntimeSpawn_Common` 3D SFX (e.g. ..._OneShot3D); `worldPosition` is `mod.Vector`.
// Optional: Info-level logs when sounds play (see Sounds.setLogging)
Sounds.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Sounds.LogLevel.Info);

const stopExplosion = Sounds.Sound3D.play(sfxAsset, worldPosition, {
    duration: 3_000,
    amplitude: 1.0,
    attenuationRange: 25,
});

// If you need to cut it short (also cancels the internal auto-dispose timer):
// stopExplosion();
```

### Example: looping / indefinite one-shot (must call `stop`)

```ts
import { Sounds } from 'bf6-portal-utils/sounds';

// In your mod: `sfxAsset` is a 2D SFX (e.g. ..._SimpleLoop2D); `somePlayer` is `mod.Player`.
// Omit `duration` for indefinite playback. You MUST keep and call `stop` to unspawn the SFX.
const stopAlarm = Sounds.Sound2D.play(sfxAsset, {
    target: somePlayer,
    amplitude: 0.8,
});

// Later (e.g. when leaving deploy screen or ending the objective)
stopAlarm();
```

### Example: instance-based playback

```ts
import { Sounds } from 'bf6-portal-utils/sounds';

// In your mod: `sfxAsset` is a 3D SFX enum value; `poiPosition` is `mod.Vector`.
const ambience = new Sounds.Sound3D(sfxAsset, poiPosition, {
    amplitude: 0.5,
    attenuationRange: 15,
});

// Start playback, then fade out over 4s (fade calls `stop()` when amplitude hits 0).
ambience.play().fade({ duration: 4_000 });

// `stop()` does not unspawn the SFX. When this instance is no longer needed (e.g. player left, objective ended), call
// `ambience.dispose()`. This is not shown here because it must run after you are done with playback, not immediately
// after `play()` / `fade()`.
```

---

## Module: timers

This TypeScript `Timers` namespace provides `setTimeout` and `setInterval` functionality for Battlefield Portal experiences which run in a QuickJS runtime, which does not natively include these standard JavaScript timing functions. The module uses Battlefield Portal's `mod.Wait()` API internally to implement timer behavior, tracks active timers with unique IDs, and provides error handling to ensure robust timer execution.

**Why use Timers instead of `mod.Wait()`?** The `Timers` module offers significant advantages: timers can be cancelled with `clearTimeout()`/`clearInterval()`, multiple timers can run concurrently without blocking, automatic error handling prevents timer failures from crashing your mod, and the familiar JavaScript API makes code more readable and maintainable. Ideal for periodic tasks, delayed actions, debouncing, and any scenario where you need cancellable or recurring delays. See the [Comparing Timers to mod.Wait()](#comparing-timers-to-modwait) section below for a detailed comparison.

### Example

```ts
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

let healthCheckInterval: number | undefined;
let respawnTimeout: number | undefined;

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Optional: Configure logging for timer callback error monitoring
    Timers.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Timers.LogLevel.Error);

    // Start a periodic health check every 5 seconds
    // Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (return void or Promise<void>)
    healthCheckInterval = Timers.setInterval(() => {
        const players = mod.GetPlayers();
        console.log(`Active players: ${players.length}`);
    }, 5_000);

    // Schedule a one-time event after 30 seconds
    // Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (return void or Promise<void>)
    Timers.setTimeout(async () => {
        console.log('Game mode has been running for 30 seconds!');
        await doSomething();
    }, 30_000);
}

export async function OnPlayerDied(
    victim: mod.Player,
    killer: mod.Player,
    deathType: mod.DeathType,
    weapon: mod.WeaponUnlock
): Promise<void> {
    // Schedule a respawn after 10 seconds
    respawnTimeout = Timers.setTimeout(() => {
        mod.SpawnPlayer(victim, mod.GetRandomSpawnPoint(mod.GetTeam(victim)));
    }, 10_000);
}

export async function OnPlayerDeployed(eventPlayer: mod.Player): Promise<void> {
    // Cancel the respawn timeout if the player already spawned.
    // You can use `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`, or `clear` - they all work the same.
    Timers.clear(respawnTimeout);
    respawnTimeout = undefined;
}

export async function OnGameModeEnded(): Promise<void> {
    // Clean up intervals when the game mode ends.
    // You can use `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`, or `clear` - they all work the same.
    Timers.clear(healthCheckInterval);
    healthCheckInterval = undefined;

    // Optional: Check how many timers are still active (useful for debugging)
    const activeCount = Timers.getActiveTimerCount();
    if (activeCount > 0) {
        console.log(`Warning: ${activeCount} timers still active after cleanup`);
    }
}
```

### Immediate Interval Execution Example

```ts
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Start an interval that runs immediately, then every 10 seconds
    // Useful for initialization tasks that need to run right away
    Timers.setInterval(
        () => {
            // Update scoreboard, check objectives, etc.
            updateGameState();
        },
        10_000,
        true // true = immediate execution
    );
}
```

## Module: button

The `UIButton` component creates an interactive button widget. Buttons support multiple visual states (base, disabled, pressed, focused) with customizable colors and opacities for each state. Buttons automatically register themselves with the UI system. Instead of a single `onClick` callback, you attach optional handlers for **click down** (`onClickDown`), **click up** (`onClickUp`), **focus in** (`onFocusIn`), and **focus out** (`onFocusOut`), which map to `mod.UIButtonEvent` `ButtonDown`, `ButtonUp`, `FocusIn`, and `FocusOut`. Handlers may be synchronous or asynchronous; while asynchronous handlers are generally preferred elsewhere (e.g. to avoid blocking event stacks), for `UIButton` the only handler running for a given engine event is this button’s handler for that event (due to unique global button referencing), so synchronous callbacks—even long-running ones—are safe.

```ts
import { UIButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/button';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Typical “activate on release” behavior uses onClickUp
const button = new UIButton({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
    onClickUp: (player: mod.Player) => {
        console.log(`Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} released the button!`);
    },
    visible: true,
});

// Update button state
button.setEnabled(false).setBaseColor(UI.COLORS.BLUE).setPressedColor(UI.COLORS.GREEN);
```

---

## Module: container

The `UIContainer` component creates a container widget that can hold child elements. Containers are useful for grouping UI elements together and managing their layout as a single unit.

```ts
import { UIContainer } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/container';
import { UIText } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Create a container with nested children
const container = new UIContainer({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 300, height: 400 },
    anchor: mod.UIAnchor.Center,
    bgColor: UI.COLORS.BF_GREY_3,
    bgAlpha: 0.9,
    childrenParams: [
        {
            type: UIText,
            message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.text.helloWorld), // 'Hello World'
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            textSize: 48,
        } as UIContainer.ChildParams<UIText.Params>,
    ],
    visible: true,
});

// Access children
console.log(container.children.length); // 1

// Delete container (recursively deletes all children)
container.delete();
```

### `UIContainer.ChildParams<T extends UI.ElementParams>`

Generic type for child element parameters in `childrenParams`. The type parameter must extend `ElementParams`. The `type` property must be set to the class constructor. This generic type enables developers to create custom UI elements (like checkboxes, dropdowns, clocks, progress bars, etc.) that integrate seamlessly with the existing UI system.

```ts
type ChildParams<T extends UI.ElementParams> = T & {
    type: new (params: T) => UI.Element;
};
```

**Example:**

```ts
import { UIContainer } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/container';
import { UIText } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text';

const container = new UIContainer({
    childrenParams: [
        {
            type: UIText,
            message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.text.hello), // 'Hello'
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
        } as UIContainer.ChildParams<UIText.Params>,
    ],
});
```

---

## Module: container-button

The `UIContainerButton` component creates a button that contains a `UIContainer` as its content. This allows you to create interactive buttons that can hold child elements, enabling complex nested UI structures within a clickable button.

```ts
import { UIContainerButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/container-button';
import { UIText } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Create a container button with nested children
const button = new UIContainerButton({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 200, height: 100 },
    onClickUp: async (player: mod.Player) => {
        console.log(`Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} released the button!`);
    },
    childrenParams: [
        {
            type: UIText,
            message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.click), // 'Click'
            anchor: mod.UIAnchor.TopCenter,
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
        } as UIContainer.ChildParams<UIText.Params>,
        {
            type: UIText,
            message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.me), // 'Me'
            anchor: mod.UIAnchor.BottomCenter,
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
        } as UIContainer.ChildParams<UIText.Params>,
    ],
    visible: true,
});

// Access the inner container
const innerContainer = button.innerContainer;
console.log(innerContainer.children.length); // 2
```

## Usage Notes

- **Inner Container Access**: Use the `innerContainer` property to access the container that holds child elements. You can use this to manage children, check the children array, etc.

- **Child Management**: Children added via `childrenParams` are automatically added to the inner container, not the button itself. Use `innerContainer.children` to access them.

- **Size Synchronization**: Setting `width`, `height`, or `size` automatically updates all three layers (outer container, button, and inner container), ensuring they stay in sync.

- **Padding**: The component supports padding, which creates space between the button border and the inner container. The inner container's size is automatically adjusted to account for padding.

- **Method Chaining**: All setter methods return `this`, allowing you to chain multiple operations together.

---

## Module: content-button

The `UIContentButton` is an abstract base class for buttons that contain content elements (such as text or images). It handles the common pattern of wrapping a `UIButton` and a content element in a `UIContainer`, managing their layout, and delegating properties appropriately. It is need because natively (via the `mod` namespace UI widget system) only containers can be parents and have children.

This class is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, use concrete implementations like `UITextButton` which extends this class, or build you own buttons with content by extending this class.

## Architecture

`UIContentButton` creates a three-layer structure:

1. **Container** (outermost) – The `UIContentButton` instance itself, which extends `UI.Element` and wraps everything
2. **Button** (middle) – An internal `UIButton` instance that handles button interactions
3. **Content** (innermost) – A content element (e.g., `UIText`, `UIImage`) that displays the button's content

The class automatically:

- Creates and manages the internal button and content elements
- Delegates button properties (colors, alphas, `onClickDown`, `onClickUp`, `onFocusIn`, `onFocusOut`, etc.) to the instance
- Delegates content properties (specified via the `contentProperties` parameter) to the instance
- Manages padding and size synchronization between all three layers
- Handles cleanup when deleted

## Constructor

The constructor is `protected` and should not be called directly. Concrete implementations should call `super()` with appropriate parameters.

```ts
protected constructor(
    params: UIContentButton.Params,
    createContent: (parent: UI.Parent, width: number, height: number) => TContent,
    contentProperties: TContentProps
)
```

**Parameters:**

- `params` – The parameters for the content button, including all `UIButton.Params` plus optional `padding`
- `createContent` – A factory function that creates the content element given a parent and a prescribed inner width and height
- `contentProperties` – An array of property names to delegate from the content element to the instance

## Usage Notes

- **Padding Handling**: When padding is set, the content element's size is automatically reduced by `padding * 2` (once for each side) to account for the padding space.

- **Size Synchronization**: Setting `width`, `height`, or `size` automatically updates all three layers (container, button, and content), ensuring they stay in sync.

- **Property Delegation**: Properties are delegated using `UI.delegateProperties()`, which creates getters, setters, and setter methods (e.g., `setPropertyName`) for each property.

- **Internal Elements**: The internal button and content elements are not exposed as public properties. Access them through the delegated properties instead.

- **Method Chaining**: All setter methods return `this`, allowing you to chain multiple operations together.

## Module: gadget-image

The `UIGadgetImage` component creates a widget that displays an image of a gadget (equipment item). Gadget images are useful for displaying equipment icons in the UI, such as in inventory screens or equipment selection menus.

```ts
import { UIGadgetImage } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/gadget-image';

// Create a gadget image
const gadgetImage = new UIGadgetImage({
    gadget: mod.Gadgets.Misc_Defibrillator,
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 64, height: 64 },
    visible: true,
});
```

---

## Module: gadget-image-button

The `UIGadgetImageButton` component creates a button with an integrated gadget image. It combines `UIButton` and `UIGadgetImage` functionality into a single element, wrapping both in a container and delegating properties appropriately.

```ts
import { UIGadgetImageButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/gadget-image-button';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Create a gadget image button with a handler (e.g. onClickUp)
const button = new UIGadgetImageButton({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 64, height: 64 },
    gadget: mod.Gadgets.Misc_Defibrillator,
    onClickUp: async (player: mod.Player) => {
        console.log(`Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} activated the Defibrillator button!`);
    },
    visible: true,
});

// Update button properties
button.setEnabled(false).setBaseColor(UI.COLORS.BLUE);
```

---

## Module: image

The `UIImage` component creates a widget that displays an image. Images are useful for displaying icons, graphics, or other visual elements in the UI.

```ts
import { UIImage } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/image';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Create an image
const image = new UIImage({
    imageType: mod.UIImageType.QuestionMark,
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 64, height: 64 },
    imageColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
    imageAlpha: 1,
    visible: true,
});

// Update image properties
image.setImageType(mod.UIImageType.Icon).setImageColor(UI.COLORS.BLUE).setImageAlpha(0.8);
```

---

## Module: image-button

The `UIImageButton` component creates a button with an integrated image. It combines `UIButton` and `UIImage` functionality into a single element, wrapping both in a container and delegating properties appropriately. The image automatically updates its appearance when the button is enabled or disabled.

```ts
import { UIImageButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/image-button';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Create an image button with a handler (e.g. onClickUp)
const button = new UIImageButton({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 64, height: 64 },
    imageType: mod.UIImageType.CrownOutline,
    imageColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
    onClickUp: async (player: mod.Player) => {
        console.log(`Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} released the button!`);
    },
    visible: true,
});

// Update button and image properties
button.setImageType(mod.UIImageType.CrownSolid).setImageColor(UI.COLORS.BLUE).setEnabled(false);
```

---

## Module: text

The `UIText` component creates a text widget for displaying text labels in the UI. Text elements support customizable font size, color, opacity, alignment, and padding.

```ts
import { UIText } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Create a text element
const text = new UIText({
    message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.helloWorld), // 'Hello World'
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    textSize: 48,
    textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
    visible: true,
});

// Update the message
text.setMessage(mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.updatedText)) // 'Updated Text'
    .setTextColor(UI.COLORS.BLUE)
    .setTextSize(36);
```

## Usage Notes

- **Message Opaqueness**: `mod.Message` is opaque and cannot be unpacked into a string. You can only create messages using `mod.Message()` with numbers, `mod.Player` types, or strings in `mod.stringkeys`.

- **Padding**: Unlike the base `Element` class, `UIText` supports padding. This allows you to add space around the text content.

- **Method Chaining**: All setter methods return `this`, allowing you to chain multiple operations together.

---

## Module: text-button

The `UITextButton` component creates a button with integrated text content. It combines `UIButton` and `UIText` functionality into a single element, wrapping both in a container and delegating properties appropriately. The text automatically updates its appearance when the button is enabled or disabled.

```ts
import { UITextButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text-button';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

// Create a text button with a handler (e.g. onClickUp for activate-on-release)
const button = new UITextButton({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
    message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.clickMe), // 'Click Me'
    onClickUp: async (player: mod.Player) => {
        console.log(`Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} released the button!`);
    },
    visible: true,
});

// Update button and text properties
button
    .setMessage(mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.updated)) // 'Updated'
    .setTextColor(UI.COLORS.WHITE)
    .setEnabled(false);
```

## Usage Notes

- **Automatic Text State Management**: When the button's `enabled` state changes, the text automatically switches between `textColor`/`textAlpha` (enabled) and `textDisabledColor`/`textDisabledAlpha` (disabled).

- **Size Synchronization**: Setting `width`, `height`, or `size` automatically updates the button widget and text size, accounting for padding.

- **Padding**: The component supports padding, which creates space between the button border and the text content. The text size is automatically adjusted to account for padding.

- **Method Chaining**: All setter methods return `this`, allowing you to chain multiple operations together.

## Module: weapon-image

The `UIWeaponImage` component creates a widget that displays an image of a weapon. Weapon images are useful for displaying weapon icons in the UI, such as in weapon selection menus or loadout screens.

```ts
import { UIWeaponImage } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/weapon-image';

const weaponPackage = mod.CreateNewWeaponPackage();
mod.AddAttachmentToWeaponPackage(mod.WeaponAttachments.Ammo_Hollow_Point, weaponPackage);
mod.AddAttachmentToWeaponPackage(mod.WeaponAttachments.Barrel_11_Extended, weaponPackage);
mod.AddAttachmentToWeaponPackage(mod.WeaponAttachments.Magazine_25rnd_Magazine, weaponPackage);
mod.AddAttachmentToWeaponPackage(mod.WeaponAttachments.Right_Laser_Light_Combo_Green, weaponPackage);

// Create a weapon image
const weaponImage = new UIWeaponImage({
    weapon: mod.Weapons.AssaultRifle_AK4D,
    weaponPackage: weaponPackage,
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 128, height: 64 },
    visible: true,
});
```

---

## Module: weapon-image-button

The `UIWeaponImageButton` component creates a button with an integrated weapon image. It combines `UIButton` and `UIWeaponImage` functionality into a single element, wrapping both in a container and delegating properties appropriately.

```ts
import { UIWeaponImageButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/weapon-image-button';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';

const weaponPackage = mod.CreateNewWeaponPackage();
mod.AddAttachmentToWeaponPackage(mod.WeaponAttachments.Ammo_Hollow_Point, weaponPackage);
mod.AddAttachmentToWeaponPackage(mod.WeaponAttachments.Barrel_11_Extended, weaponPackage);
mod.AddAttachmentToWeaponPackage(mod.WeaponAttachments.Magazine_25rnd_Magazine, weaponPackage);
mod.AddAttachmentToWeaponPackage(mod.WeaponAttachments.Right_Laser_Light_Combo_Green, weaponPackage);

// Create a weapon image button with a handler (e.g. onClickUp)
const button = new UIWeaponImageButton({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 128, height: 64 },
    weapon: mod.Weapons.AssaultRifle_AK4D,
    weaponPackage: weaponPackage,
    onClickUp: async (player: mod.Player) => {
        console.log(`Player ${mod.GetObjId(player)} activated the AK24 button!`);
    },
    visible: true,
});

// Update button properties
button.setEnabled(false).setBaseColor(UI.COLORS.BLUE);
```

## Module: ui

This TypeScript `UI` namespace wraps Battlefield Portal's `mod` UI APIs with an object-oriented interface, providing strongly typed helpers, convenient defaults, ergonomic getters/setters, and automatic management of various UI mechanics for building complex HUDs, panels, and interactive buttons. The module subscribes to `OnPlayerUIButtonEvent` via the `Events` module at load time, so button events are dispatched automatically and you must use the `Events` module for all other game event subscription.

> **Note** You **must** use the `Events` module as your only mechanism to subscribe to game events. Do not implement or export any Battlefield Portal event handler functions (`OnPlayerUIButtonEvent`, `OnPlayerDeployed`, etc.) in your code. The `Events` module owns those hooks and this module relies on it; only one implementation of each event handler can exist per project. See the [Events module — Known Limitations & Caveats](../events/README.md#known-limitations--caveats).

### Example

```ts
import { Events } from 'bf6-portal-utils/events';
import { UI } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui';
import { UIContainer } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/container';
import { UITextButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text-button';

let testMenu: UIContainer | undefined;

// The UI module subscribes to OnPlayerUIButtonEvent via Events automatically. Use Events for your game logic.
Events.OnPlayerDeployed.subscribe((eventPlayer: mod.Player) => {
    if (!testMenu) {
        // Can include children upon construction of the container.
        testMenu = new UIContainer({
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            size: { width: 200, height: 300 },
            anchor: mod.UIAnchor.Center,
            receiver: eventPlayer,
            visible: true,
            uiInputModeWhenVisible: true,
            childrenParams: [
                {
                    type: UITextButton,
                    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
                    size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
                    anchor: mod.UIAnchor.TopCenter,
                    bgColor: UI.COLORS.GREY_25,
                    baseColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
                    onClickUp: (player: mod.Player) => {
                        // Do something on release (sync or async; CallbackHandler catches errors)
                    },
                    message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.ui.buttons.option1),
                    textSize: 36,
                    textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
                } as UIContainer.ChildParams<UITextButton.Params>,
                {
                    type: UITextButton,
                    position: { x: 0, y: 50 },
                    size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
                    anchor: mod.UIAnchor.TopCenter,
                    bgColor: UI.COLORS.GREY_25,
                    baseColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
                    onClickUp: (player: mod.Player) => {
                        // Do something on release (sync or async; CallbackHandler catches errors)
                    },
                    message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.ui.buttons.option2),
                    textSize: 36,
                    textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
                } as UIContainer.ChildParams<UITextButton.Params>,
            ],
        });

        // And even add a child to the container.
        new UITextButton({
            parent: testMenu,
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            size: { width: 50, height: 50 },
            anchor: mod.UIAnchor.BottomCenter,
            bgColor: UI.COLORS.GREY_25,
            baseColor: UI.COLORS.BLACK,
            onClickUp: (player: mod.Player) => {
                testMenu?.hide();
            },
            message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.ui.buttons.close),
            textSize: 36,
            textColor: UI.COLORS.WHITE,
        });
    }

    testMenu?.show();
});
```

### Method Chaining Example

All setter methods return the instance, allowing you to chain multiple operations:

```ts
import { UIButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/button';
import { UIText } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text';

const button = new UIButton({
    position: { x: 100, y: 200 },
    size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
    onClickUp: (player) => {
        // Handle release (sync or async; errors are caught and logged by CallbackHandler)
    },
});

// Chain multiple setters together
button
    .setPosition({ x: 150, y: 250 })
    .setSize({ width: 250, height: 60 })
    .setBaseColor(UI.COLORS.BLUE)
    .setBaseAlpha(0.9)
    .setEnabled(true)
    .show();

// Or update text content with chaining
const text = new UIText({
    message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.hello), // 'Hello'
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
});

text.setMessage(mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.updated)) // 'Updated'
    .setPosition({ x: 10, y: 20 })
    .setBgColor(UI.COLORS.WHITE)
    .setBgAlpha(0.5)
    .show();

// You can also use individual x, y, width, height properties
text.setX(10).setY(20).setWidth(100).setHeight(50).show();
```

### Parent-Child Management Example

Elements automatically manage parent-child relationships. When you create an element with a parent, move it between parents, or delete it, the parent's `children` array is automatically updated:

```ts
import { UIContainer } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/container';
import { UIText } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text';

// Create containers
const container1 = new UIContainer({ position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, size: { width: 200, height: 200 } });
const container2 = new UIContainer({ position: { x: 200, y: 0 }, size: { width: 200, height: 200 } });

// Create a text element as a child of container1
const text = new UIText({
    message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.hello), // 'Hello'
    parent: container1,
});

console.log(container1.children.length); // 1
console.log(container2.children.length); // 0

// Move the text element to container2
text.setParent(container2);
// Or: text.parent = container2;

console.log(container1.children.length); // 0 (automatically removed)
console.log(container2.children.length); // 1 (automatically added)

// Delete the text element
text.delete();

console.log(container2.children.length); // 0 (automatically removed)
```

### Custom UI Elements

Custom elements (like checkboxes, dropdowns, clocks, progress bars, etc.) can be built by extending the `Element` class and accepting a `params` object that extends the `ElementParams` interface as the sole argument to their constructor. They can use the protected `_logging` member to log messages within the UI namespace, and should use `_isDeletedCheck()` to protect setter operations from being called on deleted elements. Custom button-like components should implement the `Button` interface and register themselves using `UI.registerButton()` during construction.

### Element Behavior Conventions

The following behaviors apply to the built-in UI elements in this repository. Custom elements that extend `Element` should ideally implement these conventions for consistency, but doing so is not guaranteed. Custom implementations may differ, and edge cases may exist.

- **Parent-Child Relationships**: When you create child elements via `childrenParams` (on containers), they automatically receive the container as their parent. When you instantiate a child element with a parent, it's automatically added to the parent's `children` array. The parent's `children` array is automatically maintained.

- **Recursive Deletion**: Calling `delete()` on a container recursively deletes all child elements before deleting the container itself.

- **Children Storage**: Children are stored internally as a `Set<Element>` but exposed as an array via the `children` getter.

- **Receiver Inheritance**: Child elements automatically inherit their parent's receiver unless explicitly specified in their constructor parameters.

**Method Chaining Example:**

All properties support both normal setter syntax and method chaining:

```ts
import { UIContainer } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/container';

const container = new UIContainer({
    /* ... */
});

// Normal setter syntax (does not return the instance)
container.bgAlpha = 0.8;
container.visible = true;
container.position = { x: 100, y: 200 };

// Method chaining (returns the instance for chaining)
container
    .setPosition({ x: 100, y: 200 })
    .setSize({ width: 300, height: 400 })
    .setBgColor(UI.COLORS.BLUE)
    .setBgAlpha(0.8)
    .setAnchor(mod.UIAnchor.TopLeft)
    .show();
```

## UI Input Mode Management

The `uiInputModeWhenVisible` property provides automatic management of UI input mode (which is what allows a player to click on UI buttons), eliminating the need to manually call `mod.EnableUIInputMode` in most cases. When enabled on an element, the UI module automatically handles enabling and disabling UI input mode based on the element's visibility state.

### Usage Example

```ts
import { UIContainer } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/container';
import { UITextButton } from 'bf6-portal-utils/ui/components/text-button';

// Create a menu with interactive buttons
const menu = new UIContainer({
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    size: { width: 300, height: 400 },
    receiver: player,
    uiInputModeWhenVisible: true, // Enable automatic UI input mode management
    childrenParams: [
        {
            type: UITextButton,
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
            message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.button1), // 'Button 1'
            onClickUp: async (p) => {
                // Handle release / activation
            },
        } as UIContainer.ChildParams<UITextButton.Params>,
        {
            type: UITextButton,
            position: { x: 0, y: 60 },
            size: { width: 200, height: 50 },
            message: mod.Message(mod.stringkeys.labels.button2), // 'Button 2'
            onClickUp: async (p) => {
                // Handle release / activation
            },
        } as UIContainer.ChildParams<UITextButton.Params>,
    ],
});

// Simply show/hide the menu—UI input mode is managed automatically
menu.show(); // UI input mode is enabled for the player

// ... user interacts with buttons ...
menu.hide(); // UI input mode is disabled for the player (when no other requesters exist)

// You can also enable/disable the feature dynamically
menu.uiInputModeWhenVisible = false; // Disable automatic management

// ... later ...
menu.uiInputModeWhenVisible = true; // Re-enable automatic management
```

### When to Use

- **Enable `uiInputModeWhenVisible`** only on elements that you actually intend to toggle between visible and not visible. For example, if you have a container with 4 buttons and only the container's visibility will change, set `uiInputModeWhenVisible: true` only on the container, not on the individual buttons.
- **Disable `uiInputModeWhenVisible`** (default) for elements that won't have their visibility toggled, or when you prefer to manage UI input mode manually (not recommended).
- For complex UIs with multiple interactive sections, you can enable it on parent containers to manage input mode for entire UI hierarchies.

### Notes

- The default value is `false`. Enable it explicitly when needed.
- The property can be changed at runtime via the getter/setter or `setUiInputModeWhenVisible()` method.
- The system may not work correctly if you try to manually enable or disable UI input mode with `mod.EnableUIInputMode` in any scope, since there is no way to query the runtime to determine the current UI input mode state. It's best to let the UI system handle it entirely. Alternatively, you can choose to handle UI input mode entirely yourself, as long as you do not have any elements with `uiInputModeWhenVisible` enabled.
- Elements inherit their receiver from their parent, so UI input mode management respects the receiver hierarchy.

## Event Wiring & Lifecycle

- The UI module subscribes to `OnPlayerUIButtonEvent` via the `Events` module at load time, so button UI events (press, release, focus in/out) are dispatched automatically to the handlers on `UI.Button`; see `UI.Button` and component docs for `onClickDown`, `onClickUp`, `onFocusIn`, and `onFocusOut`.
- Use the returned `Element` helpers to hide/show instead of calling `mod.SetUIWidgetVisible` manually.
- All properties support both normal setter syntax (e.g., `element.bgAlpha = 0.8;`) and method chaining (e.g., `element.setBgAlpha(0.8).show()`). Method chaining is useful when you want to apply multiple changes in sequence.
- Always call `delete()` when removing widgets to prevent stale references inside Battlefield Portal. The element will automatically be removed from its parent's `children` array. For containers, `delete()` recursively deletes all children before deleting the container itself.
- The `parent` property in parameter interfaces must be a `UI.Parent` (i.e., `UI.Root` or `UI.Container`). Parent-child relationships are automatically managed.
- **Parent-child relationships** are automatically maintained:
    - When an element is created with a parent, it's automatically added to the parent's `children` Set via `attachChild()`. Children are stored internally as a `Set<Element>` but exposed as an array via the `children` getter.
    - When an element's `parent` is changed (via setter or `setParent()`), it's removed from the old parent's children via `detachChild()` and added to the new parent's children via `attachChild()`.
    - When an element is deleted, it's automatically removed from its parent's `children` Set via `detachChild()`.
- **Receiver inheritance**: Elements automatically adopt their parent's receiver if a receiver is not explicitly specified in constructor parameters. The `getReceiver()` utility function handles this logic, checking the parent's receiver and using it if no receiver is provided. Console warnings are displayed if an element's receiver is incompatible with its parent's receiver.
- **Deleted element protection**: Once an element is deleted (via `delete()`), the `_deleted` flag is set to `true` and all setter operations are blocked using `_isDeletedCheck()`. Attempts to modify deleted elements will log a warning and return early without performing the operation.

## Module: vectors

The `Vectors` namespace provides a small set of helpers for working with 3D vectors in Battlefield Portal experiences. Because `mod.Vector` is opaque—you must use the functional `mod` API (`mod.XComponentOf`, `mod.YComponentOf`, `mod.ZComponentOf`, `mod.CreateVector`, `mod.VectorAdd`, etc.) to read or build vectors—it can be clunky to write and reason about vector math. This module defines a transparent `Vector3` type (`{ x, y, z }`) and complementary functions so you can work with plain objects when convenient, and convert to or from `mod.Vector` only when calling Portal APIs.

Key features include conversion between `Vector3` and `mod.Vector`, arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide), distance, truncation, degree/radian and rotation helpers, string formatting for debugging, and a type guard `isVector3()`. The namespace is self-contained and has no dependencies on other `bf6-portal-utils` modules.

### Example

```ts
import { Vectors } from 'bf6-portal-utils/vectors';

// Work with transparent Vector3 for math
const playerPos: Vectors.Vector3 = {
    x: 100,
    y: 0,
    z: 200,
};

const offset: Vectors.Vector3 = { x: 10, y: 0, z: 0 };
const newPos = Vectors.add(playerPos, offset);

// Convert to mod.Vector when calling Portal APIs
mod.SpawnObject(asset, Vectors.toVector(newPos), Vectors.ZERO_VECTOR);

// Or convert from mod.Vector when reading from the engine
const position = mod.GetSoldierState(player, mod.SoldierStateVector.GetPosition);
const pos3 = Vectors.toVector3(position);
const distance = Vectors.distance(pos3, targetPos3);

// Rotation from compass degrees (e.g. spawner orientation)
const rotation = Vectors.getRotationVector(90);
mod.SetVehicleSpawnerRotation(spawner, rotation);

// Debug string
console.log(Vectors.getVector3String(pos3, 2)); // e.g. "<100.00, 0.00, 200.00>"
```
